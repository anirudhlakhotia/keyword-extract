Another extremely important aspect of Advocately is that we are able to identify our users who don't love the product.

You can track your demo requests from G2C in Salesforce and measure that ROI, but I think the true value of G2C lies in the TOFU brand awareness you get from people viewing your page. And the data you get about your pageviews is not good. You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of ""Comcast LLC viewed your page"") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C.

Equally as important, as a sales leader, we also use this site for references.  All prospects will eventually ask for references prior to making a purchase.  As our business unit is growing quickly, this can often cause reference fatigue as they are hit up over and over again.  Plus, IMO the reference process isn't perfect anyway for the prospect, as they will be biased.  So instead, we have our salespeople just point their prospects to G2Crowd instead.  ""Instead of me giving you the names of my 5 best customers, why don't you go to G2Crowd instead?  There you'll find verified reviews of actual users (not analysts that have never used the tools themselves), of our solution as well as our competitors.  And then from there you can do as many backdoor references as you'd like.""  

This is win/win.  The prospect gets better reviews from users, that aren't prepped or set up....and we get our reference checks.  ",comment

369501,9193846,service_task_overview,Describe the project or task G2 Marketing Solutions helped with:,"While most businesses have now realized the importance of well-written content for their websites, there is one specific type of content that is widely embraced by all, reviews of your business, in one centralized location where others come to make key business buying decisions.

For marketers of Cazoomi, we need to get into the mix of those spec & select decisions where B2B readers, decision makers or influencers, translate into potential buyers. 

We engaged G2 to get cool B2B Infographics, Comparative reports, and key product marketing advice, which is one of the most targeted approaches to comparative based content we think. This allows our small marketing team to engage SMEs at G2 who hail from the Integration industry and know our business well.  We can then share our unique client stories with them and be creatively involved with the story we want to express to the B2B buyer who really relies on reviews and expert content when making decisions which affect not only yearly budgets but also sensitive data migration and integration compliance projects.

As a bonus, all the research and infographics are easily shareable, which makes them a great asset to use in social media platforms, email campaigns, and other digital channels our marketing team use to inform potential integration software buyers.

Overall, I could not say enough about the decision this 2017 to work with G2 to augment our product comparative marketing efforts.

Looking forward to each year penciling them into our yearly marketing budget as well.

The insight that can be shared from reviews and where users spend their time whilst on the platform allows marketers to form a view on who their buyers are and what they are interested in.

G2Crowd is changing the way we all learn about, evaluate and purchase b2b software. We don't go out to eat somewhere new without checking out tripadvisor or yelp and we certainly don't book a holiday before checking out reviews and pictures from people who have actually been there.  G2Crowd brings this piece of mind to b2b software. It amazes that many companies still make significant purchasing decisions on outdated and obscure reviews from old school analysts who have probably never used the product.

G2Crows is solving for a massively underserved market of buyer and sellers who could all do with more transparency and trust!

We also really love working with the team at G2 Crowd. Danny took extreme care to understand our company needs and expectations, and even sent us a signed ""thank-you"" note after our first webinar. (Who does this? Uhm...Danny does!) Our implementation specialist Kelly slowly and meticulously explained how to get our listing set-up. She transformed a super daunting job into very easy subtasks, and weekly met with us to review our progress. It was like eating an elephant, one bite at a time...but with less mandible engagement.

1 - Outbound emailing particular personas within accounts visiting our page/category section, using the attributes provided by G2Crowd as a way to personalize the email.

2 - Execute account-based advertising campaigns (using metadata.io), targeting the right personas within those exact accounts with personalized content.

Within the first month of running these operations, metadata.io has generated a clear ROI for our investment that revived a lost opportunity into CLOSED WON opportunity, closed an additional new new deal (6-figure deal), and generated dozens of opt-in leads/conversions from those accounts visiting our category page, our competitors page or our own page on G2Crowd.

However, this turned out to be a very positive experience, because they designed and implemented a new API specific to my needs, and fast. Turns out they could get it to me any way I wanted, I just had to wait a few weeks. I now have a Leads API that gets me the data, how and when I need it. They're already listening to the next product advancements, and I feel confident the product will continue to grow beyond its existing value, which is already at this point quite significant.

The team was fast, effective, and easy to work with during the update; Couldn't be happier.

The best part is that they follow up with detailed instructions after every call, so if you missed something, you have it in writing as a reference. ",comment

It’s one thing to deliver the company talk track around ease of use, speed, and functionality -- it’s another to reinforce the story with authentic G2 reviews that are collected from users just like them. 

As a best practice, I strongly recommend leveraging G2 reviews to authenticate your sales conversations. The market we work in can get extremely competitive and it’s important to cut through the noise, quickly. I do this by sending prospects to a reputable source of truth on how users are getting value from what we provide.

4668614,78544989,hate,What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?,"Too many email notifications - I wish they wouldn't send repetitive alerts within the same week for the same company. It's overkill, but at the same time It makes sure I don't miss anything! I know they can't share personal information but that would obviously be great! Given you don't have insights into the person who was researching on g2, you have to get a little creative and leverage a larger net for your initial outreach. 

I don't like that the last review (video) is automatically the first thing a customer sees, if this isn't a good review but there are 8 others that are, why does it have to be highlighted? I feel like our company should get to choose which video is shown on our main page on G2. 

Information isn't always accurate that is left by our customers, I can specifically see where they have made false claims. Most are not from verified customers which makes me think, could this bad review be a competitor trying to tarnish my brand?",comment

I learned how to narrow my outreach to the right persons I suspect to have triggered the g2 alert -  you can always check out location data and use that as a filter in LinkedIn sales Nav.

I also realized how much motivation the insights provide me and my team.. prospecting can be disheartening at times and having a little extra help can go a long way!

In regard to my dislike (see below) I love that we can respond to reviews left by customers.

4705629,79511060,hate,What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?,"Their algorithm is very misleading. The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks. We've found the experience with G2 to be very disappointing and borderline dishonest. I'm not hopeful that we'll hear back from them. We've discontinued all promotions of our profile on G2.",comment

The market Presence Scoring algorithm is a bit 'blurry'. We can't directly influence this and your position on the G2 grid.
Very long questionnaire, please make it lightweight because it is difficult to get customers to go through all the pages of the questionnaire in order for the review to be qualified for the report.
Also, make screenshot a required field, because it's optional now and clients don't add it, but it's a reason for you to reject the review.",comment

Well-thought-through and organized information and step-by-step manuals make it easy to navigate the platform by yourself.

But the most important is the G2 team working with you. They are professionals that help you to get the maximum from your experience. In some way, it feels like you reinforced your own team with new members who generate ideas of what else could be done to improve your marketing results and even do part of your job (like outreach and so on).

Despite needing a large upfront payment, it tends to prove more cost-effective in the long term than some of the biddable PPC directories, where you ultimately end up driving up the PPC every month but the number of clicks and leads remain the same.

Our account and customer success managers, Austin and Michael, have both been great in helping us to optimise our profile and get the most out of our G2 package.

Also, really like the new profile sections in the software categories, with the addition of extra data and ratings info.",comment
7080431,109714874,hate,What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?,"Price increase for renewal was quite a jump in 2022, which wasn't ideal.

Gathering reviews can be difficult due to the need for customers to have to log into G2 in order for them to be validated.  Obviously we understand the need to ensure reviews are genuine and of high quality, but we do get regular push-back from our customers who are willing to leave a review, but have abandoned their review or just won't complete one due to the login requirement and length of the questionnaire.  The screenshot aspect in particular has proved an annoyance for many.

It's a shame badges awarded to software providers are not displayed alongside each providers profile on the software category list.  It'd be a great addition to add extra kudos to profiles.",comment

We can also easily create social audiences to retarget those visitors, removing the manual work is a real game changer for the data we see come in. 

The support we get is also far above what I've experienced before, the team always brings ideas to our monthly calls to help us get the most from the tool.",comment

8975344,147473437,hate,What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?,"G2 itself is extremely janky. We had to write up & justify the category that we belong in because G2 didn't understand our industry. We needed to explain why we should or shouldn't be tucked up underneath other categories. We needed to explain, in long-form, why certain companies they identified as our competitors should not even *be* in the category they threw them into.

Talking with Monty, he literally could not even recognize our product category and instead provided to me pages of unrelated market segments. When I gave him the exact page in G2 that I was referring to it said ""I don't have access to live G2 database but I rely on set of structured database information which I currently lack for [my company's category].""

While we had initial traction in getting reviews once we signed the contract, that dried up quickly (after 1-2 months) and then we haven't gotten *any* reviews in the past half-year.

I wish I got sentiment analytics on the page even if someone *didn't* leave a review. I wish there was a way to know how many users were ""watching us"" or whether they had a positive brand sentiment. I can see pageviews, but I wish I could tell if folks were ""subscribed"" to our brand. So we could push updated information to those who had more than passing interest.",comment

9149175,151354649,love,What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?,"I've been working with G2 with my company's upgraded profile accounts for years now and each year is better than the last. Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.

The vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. 

Implementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.

Integrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. 

Review generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.

Buyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.

G2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time. Compared to other review vendors, the portal is always running well and ive experienced little to no system errors.",comment

Also, we gather many reviews through review sourcing campaigns, but the reviews often times aren't the highest quality, because the review form is very simple. I wish their was a middle ground of the intricateness of the G2 & TR review forms. There is also a frequent tech issues that I run into when I'm inside the vendor portal.
