Review title: G2 helps market and customer validity
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 has helped our customers publicly validate us to prospects and has helped us build pipeline and be considered for opportunities where we likely would not have been found otherwise. Also it has aided as a great validation point for customers in meetings and demo's as to our market profile and position.  It has helped us need less reference calls and enabled our customers to have a more open and valid place to voice their opinion on us.
What they disliked about the product: Not a lot to dislike.  Be great as G2 becomes more recognised by a wider audience and gives the Gartners a run for their money. 

Review title: Recommended for gaining visibility in B2B Marketing efforts 
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: It showcases a wide range of vendors with unbiased and helpful reviews for evaluating solutions within your organization. This helps companies accelerate their marketing efforts and sales cycles when shared effectively. 

The smart grid is also a really great way to show how your company is perceived in the market place.

Quarterly reports are very detailed and are helpful overviews for companies trying to evaluate vendors. 
What they disliked about the product: There aren't enough people open to reviewing products without an incentive. I still think that reviewers are honest and unbiased, but the volume is still much lower than you'd expect. 

It is costly, but we saw an ROI within weeks of launching our paid subscription with closing a relatively large deal through a lead that came in via G2Crowd. 

Review title: Credibility
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Great way to build our brand in a new space, by leveraging user success. Also, Alex Pike did a great job of helping us understand the value of the platform when we first started.
What they disliked about the product: So far so good, we are just starting to use additional features like the LinkedIn integration so can't evaluate that yet

Review title: Advocately have been instrumental to our review strategy
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The end to end service and process has been the highlight to my experience. Advocately has ensured our success by assisting us with implementing our review campaigns. They've consistently optimised our process to achieve our goals.
What they disliked about the product: There is little that I dislike. Understanding exactly what each of the features means and the flow between them has been my only slight hindrance. 

Review title: Game Changer
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Advocately facilitates a continuous flow of great reviews of your product or service on the top review sites across the web. We have had excellent service and it is clear that Advocately is committed to getting the best results for their clients. They have a vision for this space that I have not seen before, and it is a welcome innovation. 
What they disliked about the product: This is not a true dislike, but the success of Advocately for us depends on at least one other integrated service, which we fortunately already had in place.

Review title: Effortless review fetching
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It works exactly as intended. Promoters get pro-active outreach for review requests in a way that is not over-the-top. The team at advocately have made themselves available at every step in the onboarding journey as well. Great service
What they disliked about the product: Not much at this point, we just need to figure out how best to integrate it into our other systems, particularly for our Customer Success team to follow up on the passive and detractor comments. No doubt I'll get the help I'm looking for.

Review title: Great idea and good time saver
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We were previously using engagement as a criteria for requesting a review (which we were doing manually). The blend of using NPS along with the automation Advocately provides means we are getting a higher volume of higher quality reviews for less work.
What they disliked about the product: Very little. The product is currently quite feature-light but the future is bright and loads of potential.

Review title: Automate your reviews, saves you tons of time, highly recommend!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Getting reviews is an integral part of any (online) business these days but the process can be very time consuming and hard. With Advocately the entire process is automated which is a huge work load lifted. After the initial setup you just let the system do the work for you, the support is great and the product works like a charm. I can highly recommend Advocately to anyone who relies on reviews! 
What they disliked about the product: Hard to come up with anything I dislike, if pressed I would say that it would be good to have a simple explainer video of 1 minute which would quickly show the value and functionality - in the beginning it is a bit hard to understand exactly what Advocately does :-) 

Review title: I am an advocate for Advocately!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We are getting our promoters to write reviews online and refer their friends at an extremely high rate!  We can link the results from this back to revenue.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing right now.  I'm excited to see how the Advocately platform develops.

Review title: NPS and more!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Advocately helped us reach out to our top promoters and helped build out our reviews across our different platforms.
What they disliked about the product: Advocately is still a very early product - not a ton on reporting yet, but we're excited to see where they're headed

Review title: Empowering our reviews and 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Being in Customer Success, it is extremely important to know how your customers feel about your product and service and getting constant feedback is absolutely necessary. With Advocately, we get an all-in-one platform that gives us the data we need to help us engage better with our clients.
What they disliked about the product: I really can't think of anything right now.

Review title: A great tie in with net promoters
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Advocately helps us to automate the process of reaching out to get reviews from customers that love our product. Another feature I like is the ability to explore which users are our net promoters. This is much potential to continuously refine our market segments using this tool.
What they disliked about the product: There isn't anything I dislike at the moment. The product solves one problem and solves it well. Having such focus is a breathe of fresh air from other products that try to do too many things but do them poorly.

Review title: Successful NPS Campaign!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Advocately has provided us on the best insights to run our NPS campaign and to generate the reviews that are essential for customer advocacy in the SaaS solutions industry. 

They identified what works best for us in terms of getting a favorable response rate from the NPS surveys and we really have moved forward from there.
What they disliked about the product: Advocately ihas been working with us with a Tailor Made Approach to our NPS Campaign, and this is not something which is readily available.

Most NPS Products in the market are just products with limited advisory on best practices, organizations will need to invest time to find the best way to implement their campaigns successfully. 

What Advocately can bring in the future to their clients, are stellar examples of NPS campaigns execution.

Review title: Awesome product, easy to use, great service and an amazing idea! 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Advocate.ly is extremely easy to use. Patrick was very helpful in setting us up on the platform. The integration and set up was quick, templates were provided to get the best result. Everything is engineered for our success, i am very happy with the platform. 
What they disliked about the product: I've not yet found anything i dislike about advocate.ly.

Review title: Advocately has made creating an advocate marketing program a breeze.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: As a Community Manager I am responsible for crafting and executing our advocate program. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of creating an advocate program is finding the advocates. Advocately has eliminated challenge. The advocates, through Advocately, came to me! Not only do I now have a growing list of advocates, but I am able to see exactly what they love about our software. This enables me to push feedback to the marketing, development, and customer success teams so that we can enhance what people love.

Aside from the actual product, Patrick and Lachlan are amazing. Support, response times, and personality are all 10/10. You guys rock!
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing to dislike. As Advocately is relatively new, the features will continue to grow with the feedback of users. 

Review title: Advocately has driven amazing results for our business
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The support, and the experience the Advocately founders bring in having done exactly what Advocately promises for a SaaS business just like ours. The offering is spot on, and simply works. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing at all. It's all good, an outstanding offering.

Review title: Advocately has changed how we take reviews!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I used to go through a lot of steps to get reviews. I was probably spending 5-6 hours a month to get reviews. There were so many manual steps and we would barely get any reviews out of it. It always felt worth it because our Brand and reputation is very important to us. Now, with Advocately, I just set up campaigns and they take care of the rest. We initially tested it out on 40 users and within that we produced 20 reviews!!!!! The same subset of users would probably would have produced 2 or 3 reviews within my old process. 

Also, the support has been amazing! Patrick has extremely helpful at setting us up and guiding us through the onboarding process. He has been very flexible in the hours he has helped and I've always very quickly got a response to questions. 
What they disliked about the product: It's a newer product, so I feel like initially there's a bit more hand holding to get onboarded on the product. Saying that, the support was amazing and Patrick helped me get fully up and running very quickly. 

Review title: Love the product!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Advocately is very easy to use and we’ve received outstanding support from their team. It helped us understand our customer’s requirements better. We were able to see results in just a few months! 
What they disliked about the product: Haven't had a bad experience so far.  :)

Review title: New to advocate marketing but am now a believer
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: At Saleswhale, we are new to NPS and getting customer reviews on G2 Crowd. At first, I was concerned that it was going to be hard to get all these up and running manually, but Advocately has made getting setup a breeze for us.

And within the first day of getting setup on Advocately, we ran our first NPS survey, got dozens of responses, which Advocately then automatically reached out to - and we got our first 5 star review on that day itself.

Support from Patrick has been top-notch, and he was very patient and helpful in walking us through the entire process from start to finish.
What they disliked about the product: I was about to say lack of Slack integration until Patrick showed me that they have built it in, and got us integrated. They move fast on the product and engineering side - and I look forward to seeing more features from the Advocately team.

Review title: Valuable Resource for Sales
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Tells you what categories a company falls into, who they're competitors are, and what it's strengths/weaknesses are in the market place by way of customer reviews as well as their own analysis.
What they disliked about the product: What they consider 'Midmarket' seems too small to me. Think this could be changed or made more granular.

Review title: G2Crowd knows what's good
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd is a great resource in understanding comparative reviews when it comes to understanding customer satisfaction, competitor analysis and the benefits to using certain solutions.
What they disliked about the product: I can't say that I dislike anything in particular

Review title: I love G2Crowd
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd enables us to be able to show how well our product works, how customers view us and close more deals because of it.
What they disliked about the product: I have no complaints when it comes to using G2crowd.

Review title: Providing Customer input - better sales engagement`
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 crowd has allowed us to let our customers speak directly to our customers. As a sales person, I don't want to constantly be bogging down my customers with asking them to give a reference for prospects who aren't far into the sales funnel. G2 crowd allows me to provide referrals to prospects, without having to annoy my customers, before my prospects are fully qualified. I also love the full transparency required by G2, as my customers can trust that the information they are getting is trustworthy.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes it sucks when a customer leaves some negative information, but with that it allows us to understand what we need to work on in order to improve. 

Review title: Useful, relevant, validated user reviews
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The reviews, especially the fact they include 'what do you dislike' as well as 'what do you like'.  It gives a much more rounded picture.  The grids are useful, so too the ability to run grids based on user segment.  I also like the side-by-side comparisons.
What they disliked about the product: I like the category grids but there are some where I question the validity of certain vendors to appear in them.  I have some questions around the market presence algorithm but can understand why it needs to remain secret.  Finally, I think some of the reports - especially around usability and ease of set-up - currently mitigate against larger vendors with more sophisticated solutions; these feel a little unfair.

Review title: Awesome tool to collect your product reviews! 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Easy to setup, Best Support and good pricing!  
What they disliked about the product: Nothing as such. Started using this tool a month and feeling really good about the way it has brought in reviews. 

Review title: G2Crowd is a MUST for your Customer Success Team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd's platform is a great way to drive advocacy from your customers. Asking clients to review your product is a sure way to know how they actually feel about you, and in return you're empowering sales with a easy way to reach our for references pre-sales.
What they disliked about the product: I wish it was less of a burden for my customers to fill out a review.

Review title: Helpful and Thorough
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: This is my second time working with G2 and I'm impressed by recent enhancements to the platform, particularly the buyer intent activity data and the intuitiveness of the backend. Our sales team is really excited to find accounts with potential need for our solution that they wouldn't necessarily have uncovered otherwise.

I also appreciate the G2 team, they are easy to work with, helpful, thorough, and dedicated to making sure we get the most out of our investment.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing major at this time! I have been happy so far with our experience with G2.

Review title: A great investment to build trust and credibility
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like how easy it is to run reviews campaigns and leverage the tools in your listing to market you business. Have our listings on G2 Crowd has helped us tremendously in building trust and credibility with out prospects and close more business.
What they disliked about the product: I really can't think of anything I dislike about G2 Crowd. 

Review title: Extremely Responsive
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Gina Carr goes the extra mile . She is a huge help and a pleasure to work with. There is a real commitment on her part to help her clients succeed
What they disliked about the product:  It takes a lot of work to get your product profile set up on the site. There is a lot of information to complete and it can be a bit confusing. 

Review title: Decent Experience
Rating: 2.5
What they liked about the product: We've received decent service pretty consistently. The online platform is easy enough to work through. Leads are just okay.
What they disliked about the product: The LinkedIn log in is pretty hard to work with.

Review title: G2 Crowd drives high quality leads
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Overall, I am very happy with G2 Crowd. We are able to drive high quality leads to our sales team. Our reps are also great, fast to respond and always helpful.
What they disliked about the product: The only drawback I currently have would be the low volume. I am working with the reps to find a solution to help us increase our volume. 

Review title: G2 Crowd is the best!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd's team is amazing to work with! They are always very responsive and are always proactively reaching out to make sure we get the best results of the programs we are running. You can't get a better CSM than Andrew Ledet! 
What they disliked about the product: The only thing I can think of for improvement is there is still a lot of reliability on AdRoll for activating retargeting programs. 

Review title: G2Crowd leads the pack of review sites
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd has invested heavily in advertising their brand versus the other review sites.  As a result they have a much bigger quantity of reviews.  So it has traction now and people trust it to create a shortlist and to determine what others think.
What they disliked about the product: G2Crowd rank not given enough prominence. Don't like paid for reviews (think this should be charity donation only) as encourages people to make up reviews.  I think there should be some way of seeing the balance of reviews from particular companies (at the moment you could have 100 reviews from a single customer which could skew review count).

Review title: Best Tech Review Site on the Internet
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd provides a very impartial and fully verified technology software review forum. The technology sections are well defined and nicely summarized.  Overall, it's very professional and you can actually count on the review provided since they can't be manipulated by the vendors.   Really like the way that we can embed the review widgets on our own website with links to our optimized landing page.  The environment provides a great user experience for visitors to our website and illustrates how open we are to input from our customers. The style of review presentation is also very easy for visitors to consume. It's similar to consumer based review sites, but with much higher data quality.  We count on the fact that prospects reading our reviews can trust the customer input.
What they disliked about the product: Difficult to say what I dislike, but if I had to choose I would say that sometimes the technology categories are too general. This can result sometimes in very different, non-competitive products in the same category.  This makes products hard to compare at times.

Review title: If you aren't working with G2 Crowd, you should be!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I really enjoy working with G2 Crowd for a few reasons, one of them being their customer support. The team at G2 Crowd has worked hand in hand with Certify to create custom content to better suit our needs and help position Certify stronger in the selling process. 

From a technology standpoint, I really value the competitive analysis aspect of G2 Crowd. The fact that a prospect can search and compare over 1,000 reviews on expense management in minutes and rank the top performing vendors is really invaluable. Having this Yelp-like review process for business software has allowed us to showcase our strengths against competitors and replace the traditional client referral process. 
What they disliked about the product: There really is not much if anything that I dislike about G2 Crowd. Naturally, as the company has grown, so has their pricing which can make budgeting and forecasting harder. I do also wish there were additional ways for Certify to generate more leads out of the system but I also understand this isn't their core solution offering. 

Review title: Best software review site - and a lead source too!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I originally signed up with G2 Crowd to generate awareness of our solution as they had the most product/ competitor reviews for our industry (PR tools and media targeting) and had a robust process to help you generate reviews for products. But I was blown away, when on top of awareness and SEO magic, G2 Crowd has also become a key source of sales leads for us. 
What they disliked about the product: Setting up the product profiles is a bit cumbersome and I wish we could have a corporate page with individual products listed so people could see our entire portfolio. 

Review title: G2Crowd is a very solid platform. Its on-boarding process and user experience are pleasingly fluid.
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The configuration and on-boarding process for a vendor is very straightforward, intuitive and yet comprehensive. I also like the experience provided by G2Crowd to users researching products. It is fluid and informational. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing.  G2Crowd is a great company, they just need to extend their SEO penetration (at least in my category) to better generate organic leads.

Review title: G2 Crowd Has Great New Functionalities
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I like the clean look and feel of the website. They also have instant chat which is nice if you have a question that you need answered really quickly. The CSM I have is knowledgeable, responsive and helpful.
What they disliked about the product: I wish the average/total score would be updated more frequently. It looks like I have gotten a lot of 4.5 and mostly 5 star ratings, but it hasn't moved in like 9 months or so. It used to move more frequently at the beginning when we first drove traffic to the site, when I first started.

Review title: Great product & customer service
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I've appreciated the opportunity to get honest reviews from our customers. It's opened up the opportunity to hear their feedback and also showcase our value to prospects. 

Additionally, I've loved the customer support I've gotten from Mark! He's always been incredibly helpful, friendly, honors his commitments, and holds me accountable for getting our campaign done!
What they disliked about the product: Honestly, I haven't really found anything.

Review title: Helps us drive revenue
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We are in a competitive marketplace and we rely on G2 Crowd to help us stand out from our competitors.  
What they disliked about the product: We don't see a lot of people actually request a demo from our G2 profile page, but that is not unexpected.  

Review title: A good platform that will only get better
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: I think the Customer Success Management team is really accessible and helpful when I have questions.
What they disliked about the product: The system could be a bit more intuitive and cleaner for end users coming to look at reviews. You guys should get rid of that grid. It is confusing as heck. I am not a proponent of copy catting all the time, but on this one you could just take a que from Yelp or Tripadvisor in terms of how to present the best company in each category.  A list view is much better and simpler.  Also, I think you guys should better figure out the right companies that should be in a respective category. For us, there are people in our category whose primary product is not in our category yet they are able to rank higher than us in our category because they got more reviews in there primary category. It's a bit misleading I think for the end users relying on your site for reviews.

Review title: G2crowd is a must have for finding the voice of your customers
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I've used G2crowd now for over 3 years at different companies and we continue to utilize them as a trusted vendor because of the ability to gather feedback from clients quickly and easily. By running review campaigns we can uncover what areas of focus we need for our product and how to identify new advocates for our programs. The grid reports also help us stay relevant to our competitors and the marketplace.
What they disliked about the product: I wish there was more customization with the review questions and a way to provide ongoing feedback from customers that have posted reviews previously. Other review sites allow this and it would be great to have this feature added. 

Review title: Very Useful Platform - Think "Yelp for Business/Enterprise Software"
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's a great resource if you're looking for honest reviews on a software solution. You can read through both the good and bad about a particular offering, so that you can walk into purchase decisions much better informed. 
What they disliked about the product: I wish the company had even stronger brand awareness - several other colleagues in B2B haven't heard of the platform yet, so it will take a bit longer to build higher credibility/become the gold standard for reviews. 

Review title: G2 Crowd  AlienVault User Review 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Site is so easy to use - even for the most non-tech person like me! Also, G2 Crowd team is very responsive when you have questions or concerns and does their best to either fix the problem or get others from the extended team involved to resolve or come up with a viable and workable solution. One very nice capability is the widget tool. I love that it's embedded in the admin portal and it's super easy to understand and share. It's definitely something that I will use to help socialize the customer reviews. 
What they disliked about the product: Would like to see reviews dive a bit deeper into the customer's usage such as use case. Also, it would be nice to have extended sorting capabilities such as region and use case.

Review title: Great service and support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: -Reading feedback from customers has been amazing!  We've been encouraged by how much people love Bonusly, and the reviews have had great ideas.

-Also, our onboarding specialist Anna was helpful, friendly, flexible, and responsive. I always had the information I needed and we got off to a great start. 
What they disliked about the product: I'd like to be able to tag the reviews to identify common themes and export the reviews into an excel or csv. doc. 

Review title: Incredibly simple, but powerful tool to acquire positive customer reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Based on SatisMeter NPS, Advocately absolutely geniously helped us double the number of positive reviews in Capterra for just 1 month. We love personal attitude and great service. The system is easy-to-use, we enjoy UX. We look forward to bringing new reviews about Mailigen. Because review websites and reviews are one of the best traffic sources for us. 
What they disliked about the product: I have nothing to say here. We are wishing good luck and future growth for Advocately. 

Review title: Great vendor!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a great sales and marketing resource for our company. It provides lead generation and content as well as an opportunity to harness genuine feedback from our customers. 
What they disliked about the product: At least for the program we are running, G2 requires a lot of internal resources in order to garner the full benefits of the platform. I believe it will pay off in terms of high quality leads/ROI; however, expect some time to see significant results. 

Review title: Great platform!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I enjoy the ease of logging in and seeing how the pages I own are performing and doing. Navigating is straightforward.
What they disliked about the product: I wish to gain more visibility or training on how to utilize the features/tools G2 has put in place.

Review title: Love Working with the G2 Crowd Team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love being able to reach out to Walter with any questions I have. I also love how many reports G2 Crowd offers related to rankings, usability, service, and support!
What they disliked about the product: Because G2 Crowd offers so many reports I wish the price wasn't so high to license each one.

Review title: Some great behind the scenes tools, as G2 Crowd grows, so does their value.
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Kara DeWalt has been a friendly and responsive rep . She's quick to make suggestions and help out with our different marketing options.  Kara has been awesome!

The reviews written on G2 Crowd are comprehensive and very useful for consumers. 

They're growing their marketing tools, and we're trying a few of them out. 

I like the backend options for building out our profile to best educate our prospects on the value of our service. You can upload videos, FAQs, and key details about the software.  Their reporting features are relevant and accurate as well.

Love their award badges as a great form of social proof.
What they disliked about the product: We're trying out their sponsored content marketing program, but it's in its early stages and hasn't produced impressive results yet. It could be due to the ad design, but we'd like to see better results.

Their webhooks feature for leads is a little confusing, if you don't have any web dev experience.

The evaluation grid seems to favor market size, so if you don't work with enterprise businesses, you will never be labeled as a 'market leader' despite having a top notch review portfolio. 

The comparison reports are overpriced for smaller startups.

Review title: Genuine Validation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It''s too easy for companies to post anonymous quotes from supposed customers.  Too many reviews are cliches.  G2 offers us a legit third party system and the reviewers are all validated through LinkedIn.  
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes the leads that arrive are highly unqualified but I'm not sure that's G2's fault.

Review title: G2 Crowd for IBM WCE
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I thoroughly enjoy the G2 Crowd tool.  It's very easy to use and navigate.  I recently set up close to 10 pages for my organization and everything was very seamless.
What they disliked about the product: At this current time, there is nothing that I am unhappy with.

Review title: Great service, easy solutions
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Very simple to get started bringing in detailed reviews from happy customers, the team is always available to help out and come up with new ideas. 
What they disliked about the product: Not much that I dislike that we haven't solved with iteration on targeting, messaging & etc

Review title: Intuitive Platform for B2B Reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Everything on the site is streamlined and intuitive for both the user and the vendor. They offer lots of features to utilize as a vendor, and they have a lot of things that help you promote your page.
What they disliked about the product: It would be nice to have some more customizability over the buttons on your vendor page. They are working on this after feedback, though.

Review title: Good to collect customer testimonials, not so good for leads
Rating: 2.0
What they liked about the product: 1. Overall good approach - good to collect customer feedback
2. Most players seem to prefer G2Crowd
What they disliked about the product: 1. G2Crowd promised lots of leads, but leads are few and far
2. The embed feature is limiting - I do not have the ability to take specific sections from the testimonial and embed them. 

Review title: Great way to get in front of potential buyers doing independent research.
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Easy to work with. Review campaigns are a great way to get reviews kicked off. Accounts team is proactive in finding you ways to increase reviews and exposure. 
What they disliked about the product: Outside of the basics, ideas are limited. Suggestions seem to always include spending more money with them. Inbound lead activity wasn't great in our experience, but we have a very specific product.

Review title: Product reviews are essential
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The concept - customer reviews for B2B products.  The simplicity.  They are the leaders in this area.
What they disliked about the product: The grid.  The way G2 assesses market presence is misleading.

Review title: Helped us skyrocket our credibility
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The depth of criteria that G2 Crowd puts together the reports are very granular and thorough. For an underdog brand like ourselves, this credibility was invaluable. The team was super helpful in helping navigate the product and strategize with execution on our end. 
What they disliked about the product: Would love to be able to customize qualification questions before anyone can request a demo.

What they liked about the product: Creating a profile on G2 Crowd gives an opportunity to build a comprehensive overview of your product/service.
What they disliked about the product: I don't like that some elements on the profile page are not customizable, for example, the Watch a Demo button cannot be renamed.

Review title: we get leads from them
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: we get leads from them. they also provide analytics on your page.
What they disliked about the product: the survey process to review your company is like a million questions

Review title: Smooth and  helpful resources every step of the way
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The onboarding process went very smoothly. If we had a question or concern, G2 Crowd's onboarding staff answered  all emails and phone calls within the hour. The service we received was impeccable.
What they disliked about the product: We've been with G2 Crowd for only a few months. So far we have been pleased with what we have received.

Review title: G2 Crowd is a well thought-out service
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I like the wealth of  info and tools for related to our product reviews. As well, G2 Crowd's handling of the campaign to acquire ouru reviews was smooth and simple.
What they disliked about the product: I had a little trouble at first with establishing contact with our ongoing rep. The person who helped us set up the campaign and review site was super helpful and clear in her instructions.

Review title: Easy Breezy Solution with Phenomenal Support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is an intelligent solution that's easy to use. Any busy software company will be able to get started quickly—and there is plenty of help along the way from the G2 Crowd team to optimize your listing.

The G2 Crowd review formatting is so much better than other platforms, set up in a way that encourages lengthy feedback. Reviews we see here from our happy customers are always super detailed and useful, giving us golden insights we can use for customer success, sales, and marketing intelligence.

We've been extremely impressed by the level of support from G2 Crowd. This likable team is with you every step of the way, because they truly care about your company's success.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike here. They are very open to any feedback we have provided. 

Review title: Solid results from G2 Crowd
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 offers a powerful medium for our software users to share their experience with the world.  We're able to differentiate ourselves and provide references to potential new customers prior to ever engaging with them.
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing about the solution that we do not like

Review title: Simple Platform, Great Service
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Team is very personable and easy to talk to. The platform is simple enough to use in the back-end, everything is labeled clearly and I don't feel like I am lost looking for what I need.
What they disliked about the product: I have a variety of products that I am using and I wish all three could be on the same page. It's kind of annoying to send customers different pages to write reviews on if they use more than one of our products.

Review title: Great service and fast response!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I love being able to contact Kara from G2 Crowd at any time about anything! She helps me fill out the profile and give me suggestions on how to take full advantage of it!
What they disliked about the product: logging in is easy, but I wish it would send me straight to my company profile instead of having to search for it.

Review title: A good platform review platform
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The platform is very user friendly and the customer service are fast and responding back to question
What they disliked about the product: We can't use our own form, which is not a deal breaker.

Review title: Good  Quality leads 
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product:  From an ender user's perfective  g2 crowd provides unbiased and "real world" facts for those  in the process of selecting a Saas product . From a Vendor Perspective,  the quality and consistency of leads we have received is  very much above average .
What they disliked about the product: the lead scoring  for the reports is  heavily influenced  by volume rather than quality .

Review title: G2 Crowd is a Great Resource for Customer Testimonials
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd provides an easy-to-use service that allows our customers to quickly create testimonials and describe their use. It's a great resource for prospective customers researching emergency notification software. We often use it in our email marketing to prospective customers.
What they disliked about the product: Since we don't use the portal on a regular basis, it can be challenging at times to know where everything is at and how to make changes. It would be great if as an admin I could select a series of reviews that I'd like to highlight and make them available on our website. It would be great to see a G2 Crowd brand-free RSS feed that would allow us to publish testimonials to our website. 

Review title: Adequate at best
Rating: 3.0
What they liked about the product: The reviews feature has helped us out in gaining credibility and increasing brand awareness.
What they disliked about the product: The lead feature has been of absolutely no use to us.

Review title: President & Founder of Oceanos
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It provides our prospects and current clients a destination spot to to learn about Oceanos directly from our customers. 
What they disliked about the product: I have no dislikes with G2 at this time.  

Review title: Good Review Platform
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is a great review platform that allow prospects to educate themselves about software by reading the experience of other users. We include review snippets on our Customers Success Stories website page and email campaigns. 
What they disliked about the product: Not much really, the account managers are very helpful and open to feedback. It can be a bit pricey for small business, but not above market rate. 

Review title: Helpful service & meaningful content
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Their customer service is excellent. No question goes unanswered for long. They always provide a prompt and thorough response.
What they disliked about the product: Some of the predefined page set ups. For example, the word "software" is at the end of our product name.  The product is a software but the sentence sounds odd with software at the end. 

Review title: Add another channel to your inbound marketing
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd gets great traffic, even in my company's lesser known product category. By pushing the pageviews to Slack via Zapier the entire sales and marketing team can easily get a sense of how many people are landing on our page every day. It's between 10-15. G2C isn't a huge source of demo requests, but the awareness from this website is good.

CSMs are very responsive (thanks Mark!)
What they disliked about the product: It's impossible (or at least very hard) to quantify the ROI. You can track your demo requests from G2C in Salesforce and measure that ROI, but I think the true value of G2C lies in the TOFU brand awareness you get from people viewing your page. And the data you get about your pageviews is not good. You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of "Comcast LLC viewed your page") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C. Maybe it's a great first touch channel, but you'll never really know.

Review title: Essential Part of our Marketing Mix
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Transparency of customer feedback to public channels. 
What they disliked about the product: Applying reviews to multiple categories. Our technology meets the needs of multiple product categories, and it should be easier to ensure that our reviews pertain to all. 

Review title: Got References?
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It makes our lives much easier and as they are verified users, its genuine.  There's nothing to hide, which promotes good partnership.  
What they disliked about the product: Doesn't always have every solution / every product.

Review title: Hidden Gem in any online business marketing strategy 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Personally, I love the reports they generate which help us make key marketing idea decisions which we roll out on our sites each quarter.
What they disliked about the product: I think they could improve the way videos for readers are displayed like a YouTube grid instead of the current format.  That's about it.

Review title: Was hoping for a bit more
Rating: 2.5
What they liked about the product: I like the analytics components. It’s quite interesting to see which companies are comparing us to which vendors.
What they disliked about the product: We upgraded to license the grid and badge for our category.  Unfortunately, “Leader” badges are only added/updated on your profile when a report for the category which you are a Leader in is generated. There is no report scheduled for the category which are are a “Leader” in.

G2Crowd should update badges on profile when/as companies move around on the grid, otherwise the profile pages are inaccurate. In the category description it says "Leaders include: [our brand]" but our profile is reflecting we are a “High Performer” when we are actually a “Leader.”

Review title: Great Tool! 
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The reporting functionality and insight into customer needs.
The ability to give customers and prospects insight into their peer's thoughts 
The support I have received thus far.
What they disliked about the product: There is not a streamlined process in handling reviews. This gets to be daunting and cumbersome. 
I would like to see more documentation on best practices with reports, spiffs and responses. 

Review title: Revolutionary approach to purchasing B2B tech
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crows is the best unfiltered and comprehensive platform to learn about strengths and weaknesses of various b2b tech in the market both established and contending.

The comparisons are also great because they turn unstructured written reviews into actionable and measurable data across a range of metrics.  This means a decision maker can choose to focus on overall ratings, specific features, or the various rich and qualitative reviews.

What's more, all of this is based on validated profiles, so no fake reviews.


What they disliked about the product: The only downside is that some product categories are less rich in reviews than others. Something that surely will take time to develop but worth looking forward to.

Review title: A Marketer's Silver Bullet 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's the age of the customer, let's face it. Which means as marketers we must embrace the voice of our customers to build brand and drive demand. G2Crowd Marketing Solutions not only allow us to manage a branded profile - host assets for download and offer various CTAs for lead gen purposes, but they also help in ensuring your company follows best practices when it comes to recruiting and leveraging reviews. In addition, they offer super valuable competitive comparison reports to help your sales team deposition the competition, shorten sales cycles and ultimately win more deals! Lastly, they've got a wealth of data that your marketing team can leverage for better intel and retargeting purposes. Also, kudos to Matt Lazares, our client manager, who has been stellar to work with -- smart and knows how to work with his clients to ensure they get the most impact out of their investment. 
What they disliked about the product: If there was something that I disliked, I wouldn't be taking the time to review the product offering.... But, the only thing I am waiting from them on is an API direct integration to SFDC so we can more readily leverage the active search data and push it to our sales team faster. (Update: we are now part of the BETA program for the G2Crowd SFDC connector!)

Review title: Essential and Effective
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd is an essential customer touchpoint in our audience's evaluation and buying process. It allows us to invite our customers to review/promote us online where others are looking, we can brand our page and we can capture contact information of those interested in a solution like ours. And when we need our account manager is there to help!
What they disliked about the product: There's nothing I can think of that I dislike, except we can't control the traffic to our page as we would increase that if we could.

Review title: G2 Crowd is an easy platform for companies to use and customers to consume!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I'm an admin for two products for my company. As a marketer, this platform is easy to manage, edit widgets, and pull from for my own use (social media, website promotions, email, etc). The user interface is clean, easy to navigate, and a great tool for our sales reps to use.

The customer service and sale reps have helped us make this an successful marketing campaign. Giving us great ideas to push these reviews in multiple ways. And THEY reach out to our customers for the reviews! I love when vendors help with heavy lifting. 
What they disliked about the product: Probably more brand recognition of the site. I think G2 Crowd has a lot of potential -- and the more recognition they get, the more people will see and trust our reviews!

Review title: Simple, convenient -- it works!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Makes it easy to generate more product reviews for our SaaS tool. It's very easy to setup and follows a logical process. Our tool is multi-language and this is easily supported with Advocately. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really. While their team is still building out new features that will may eventually become "core" to their platform, it already does the basics of what we need and their team is very responsive when helping us with additional needs. 

Review title: G2Crowd is a great channel for lead generation and customer testimonial generation! 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The great custom on boarding by the account team has helped us set up a successful review campaign very fast.

This platform has added a new dimension to our demand gen and marketing programs. The unbiased review platform is a great tool for presenting our product to buyers in the research stage and educating them about our product.   

It's been a great way to gather customer feedback in a simple and trustworthy format, which makes it easier to share with new clients. Overall an amazing experience, and we have been thrilled to see how much our customers love the Falcon platform!


What they disliked about the product: There could be made improvements to the visitor and prospect reports so that those leads and stats could be leveraged better. 

Also would be great if the Leader batches are updated more often to allow for profile reflection of rid changes. 

Review title: Great customer review platform for businesses
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is a great platform to help promote customer advocacy and gather reviews from users. As a profile admin, its easy to update our page, add features, and invite our customers to submit their reviews.
What they disliked about the product: There are sometimes some bugs on the admin side that prevent me from updating certain things right away, but those issues get addressed quickly by the G2 Crowd team.

Review title: Very happy with G2 Crowd
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Working with Tony Furnas was the absolute best, he was insightful and very supportive as we looked for ways to increase the quantity and quality of our reviews in order to improve our online reputation.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to report - Tony made everything a breeze.

Review title: Go To Reference Site
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love how the reviews are filtered and how well customers are featured. The ability to do direct compares against competitors is also a plus to see exactly where we are. 
What they disliked about the product: I'm not too keen on the reporting tools available at the moment. It's hard to get key word searches and sentiment analysis so we can be more responsive as a company. HOWEVER, G2Crowd's research team is awesome and they have confirmed that these features are coming on the roadmap.

Review title: Immediately delivered value to IPfolio
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Works like a parallel website, generating brand awareness and leads
What they disliked about the product: Nothing so far! You will need potentiall some expertise to hook up the advanced features and eg integrate with your CRM, but nothing too hard. 

Review title: G2 Crowd's customer service reps are fantastic to work with
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Everyone is extremely helpful when it comes to any questions we may have. High response rate as well.
What they disliked about the product: Not much to dislike about this product. 

Review title: Game Changer for CSM Teams and Sales
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd has been invaluable to help build our referral program, and to help support our Sales team in the past. Reviews are quick and easy to fill out, and help foster customer advocacy.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing I dislike, just the more data we can get to help support competitor comparisons, the better.


Review title: Simple set-up with fast results
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Advocately has heavily increased our online  customer reviews through  friendly effective campaigning. The set up was so simple,  their  integration specialist had us live after having had 1 call together.
What they disliked about the product: So far we have been using Advocately for a few months and we have no complaints.

Review title: Advocately Works!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Sending personalised emails via gmail to our "promoter" customer base in the background with little input from us. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike. It works well for our business and the onboarding was done via a 1 on 1 webinar. 

Review title: Terrific results from exposure on the G2Crowd web site
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We are seeing great prospects and customers coming to G2Crowd for unbiased opinions and reviews that help SpringCM get off to a great start in a sales or upsell cycle.  For instance one of our largest deals closing this quarter will come from a prospect that was not engaged with us previously that went first to G2Crowd, then contacted us through www.springcm.com and signed for a multi-six figure initial deal value.   The business model of G2Crowd gives comfort in that the information was not paid for or biased in any way, which helps us greatly in the initial stages.
What they disliked about the product: We'd like to expand our activities with G2Crowd, but understand that in order to remain independent the company is very stringent in the activities SpringCM can have with them.

Review title: Great tool for Sharing Unbiased Information with Prospects
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: My favorite feature is the comparison grid that allows prospects to see how we stack up against our competitors and the focused profile that we can send to prospects.
What they disliked about the product: The visitors section gives me mostly individuals who are not relevant to our business.

Review title: Strong review platform for B2B software discover & social proof. 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: 1.  Strong focus on review management.
2.  Well thought-out process for maintaining authenticity.
3.  Value-driven marketing platform which enhances PR and social proof. 
4. Strong support from the G2 crowd team.
What they disliked about the product: It can seem like there is a lot happening in the platform initially which can make self-implementation a cumbersome process. 

Review title: Great support team!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The peristance of the team to help my company acheive their objectives. G2 Crowd well unnderstands their roll and makes it their business to undersatand the product line(s) of their custoemrs.
What they disliked about the product: Lead generation is probably G2 Crowd's weakest link.

Review title: One of the best peer review sites for B2B SaaS solutions
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd provided the best onboarding experience compared to some of the other peer review sites I have used. Our dedicated account manager and implementation specialist worked with us through every step ensuring that we were leveraging all that G2 Crowd has to offer.
What they disliked about the product: It is not possible to download all the customer reviews for further processing. There is a paid product that gives you additional insights but it doesn't directly provide an easy export option for all reviews either.

Review title: Easy to Manage and Great Support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's straightforward and easy to manage. The admin console for product pages is simple to use. There are a lot of great tools to leverage across marketing content and campaigns. And certainly not least, everyone in the company benefits from hearing directly from customers about what is and is not working for them.
What they disliked about the product: I would like to be able to collect more customized data.

Review title: G2 Marketing is the Most Reliable Reviewer on the Market
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is a best-of-industry service that provides an awesome review of enterprise products and services.  It will save you at least half the time you would invest discovering this information on your own.
What they disliked about the product: At times there's too much data but that's easily solved by time and patience.

Review title: Great tool for research
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: This tool provides almost everything that you need when you are researching and trying to see what your competitiors are doing. Its a must-have for every marketing researcher.
What they disliked about the product: Some informations about companies are not full, and sometimes there are not enough to compare solutions with each other correctly.

Review title: Great Experience and Exposure
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team really knew what we needed to accomplish and worked with us every step of the way to ensure we met our review goals. 
What they disliked about the product: There is really nothing I can say I dislike at the moment. 

Review title: Great tool and exceptional support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2's marketing solution is a great tool to ensure your company provides potential customers with the kind of useful information that guides them to a well-educated decision.

From the start, G2 provides excellent support in getting you ramped up and helping you to understand all the features, benefits and how to operate all the tools to make sure you're taking full advantage of everything at your disposal. 

Back-end management is easy and intuitive and the dedicated support folks are responsive, friendly and helpful. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing comes to mind. Perhaps more front-end customization capabilities but that's minor.

Review title: Great service and support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The personal touch from the G2 Crowd team. Always willing to help and going the extra mile to answer your questions
What they disliked about the product: So far we just finished the on boarding so we are relatively new. 

Review title: Responsive and great to work with
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our account team was great to work with and made the process so easy. When our campaign didn't get off to the immediate start we wanted, they immediately jumped in with ideas that ended up driving results. 
What they disliked about the product: We would have liked being able to offer different charity options to our clients so they could choose what mattered to them, but that's about it!

Review title: Excellent!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The reporting and support. They can improve the effectiveness of each campaign and allow you to tailor your review requests to different client segments.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes it can take a few days for Advocately to capture a review that has been made on Capterra or Xero.

Review title: Great to work with!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is a great way to get brand awareness. They are extremely helpful and available to assist when we need them. As new customers, they worked with us to find a plan that suited our needs and budget, and continue to help us through the onboarding process.
What they disliked about the product: We wish there was a way that we could block analytics coming from our IP addresses, so as to differentiate visitor traffic from our team monitoring and updating the pages.

Review title: Helpful setup, see potential for a new lead gen channel
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: My team has been reduced in half in a month, so the time I had available to dedicate to this was limited and I was really concerned about this. But Kristina was great and patient in understanding my concerns and addressing them quickly, making the setup process go smoothly and quickly.
What they disliked about the product: I wish there were more options  that we can do to our profile ourselves without having to log a ticket with Support. It would also be preferable if I can respond to reviews as Planday, instead of as my personal LinkedIn profile. As such, I can only comment. This should be changed.

Review title: Easy to use and great to work with
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The sales/support team members are attentive and responsive
What they disliked about the product: not 100% user friendly reports but reports itself are good

Review title: Patient and valued partner
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to source reviews through their programs at our pace and comfort level. Our G2 Crowd reps provide us with education, options and understand our deliberative pace. They nudge, but they don't push or pressure to jump into strategies we're not ready to implement. 
What they disliked about the product: Lack of permissioning options. It would be nice to be able to authorize certain members of our management and support teams to respond to reviews without giving them access to all of the admin dashboard. It would be nice if we also had the option to respond as the company instead of individuals. 

Review title: Solid lead gen source
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: I like receiving leads that are low-funnel. Once people are shopping us against competitors, I know they are serious about implementing a platform.
What they disliked about the product: It can take a while to get your parameters clear and narrow enough so that we don't get any waste.

Review title: Smooth and simple setup
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd provides a smooth and simple setup. The navigation is setup to get you where you need to go fast and see the most relevant data. The integration with Hubspot and Salesforce is great and easy to setup. 
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes the backend would miss saving changes or not show updates. More detailed analytics would be helpful.

Review title: Helpful assistance from account managers along the way
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Quick help from the G2Crowd team made it much easier to get our profile and lead forms set up the way we wanted them. 
What they disliked about the product: Side navigation under the admin view is not ideal (hard to find what you are looking for sometimes based on how everything is categorized). 

Review title: Great support and platform
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is definitely top of class and leader when offering features for a directory site. G2 Crowd is a well-known name in the directory market. They offer several features that no other directory site has.
What they disliked about the product: Our business goal is to drive traffic externally and we haven't seen any significant success yet in comparison to other tools.

Review title: We love Advocately
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Its clever design and leveraging of NPS promoters.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing comes to mind. Advocately is quite impressive.

Review title: Great team, premium service
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Flexibility when adapting to each client. G2 Crowd has "out of the box" packages that should be enough to cover software companies needs. However, if you talk with your assigned team about the peculiarities of your business, they will do whatever possible to adapt their services to you. With increidble motivation and skill.
What they disliked about the product: The platform lacks multi-language support and is too much USA oriented. Software market is global and even when most of activities are ok being in English, there are a lot of reviewers out there that feel more comfortable writing something as personal as a review in their own language. On the other hand, G2 Crowd is struggling to get on the top (if it hasn't already) of the Software Review credibility and reputation score table. They do effords commuincating their platform to the USA market and USA software consumers, that efford would be welcome in other languages and countries too.

Review title: G2 is a great platform for B2B Reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Having a platform like G2 that allows prospective customers of Leadiro to easily search for B2B data providers and not only find us but also get access to insights from our customers is really great. The platform layout makes it really easy to compare the market place quickly in an honest and transparent way. I also found the on boarding process very helpful.
What they disliked about the product: Feedback from some of our customers was that they struggled to redeem their vouchers. I think G2 can work a bit of this to make it easier to redeem the rewards.

Review title: Friendly, easy and provides great insight into customer experiences
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 Crowd directory and review system allows us to see how our customers feel about our service, and let's visitors see what options are available.  G2 Crowd staff is attentive and very helpful getting our profile in place quickly.
What they disliked about the product: Everything was likable - on-boarding and set-up was simple.  

Review title: Just finished onboarding and our first campaign
Rating: 2.5
What they liked about the product: The Implementation Specialist I worked with was fantastic - diligent, dogged (I can get distracted), and full of excellent suggestions.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing yet! We've gone live, customers have submitted reviews - it all looks good so far.

Review title: Great marketing intelligence platform that's growing fast
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Flexibility to adapt to our goals & needs. The G2 Crowd team has taken the time & effort to talk to us, understand how we can get the best value out of their platform and give us options that work well with the goals and needs of our business. Although their price points for the different offerings have gone up significantly over the past year, we have been able to get options that fit within our budget. The platform is easy to administer and manage (with an automatic integration to Salesforce that works great for us). The review process is straightforward for our users to follow and the G2 Crowd team is again very helpful in working with us to facilitate review outreach campaigns.
What they disliked about the product: Some of the more advanced offerings pitched to us at different times were not fully baked and required manual integrations to have them set up. Also, I think customers can benefit from finer filtering criteria and better validation of contact info in the lead generation offerings (for instance, occasionally last names or phone numbers are incomplete or missing from leads that get passed to us).

Review title: Best Review Site to Work With
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Both Ryan and Kristina were a pleasure to work with - patient and thorough with explanations, and with call follow-up emails. The thing that makes G2 Crowd stand out is its vendor portal. Other sites don't really have anything close to the feature depth that G2 Crowd has.
What they disliked about the product: I really couldn't say. I've enjoyed using G2 Crowd's Marketing Solutions.

Review title: Best Onboarding Ever
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The onboarding process is the best one I've ever been through.  They helped us get up and running from basically no presence to High Performer in a few weeks time.
What they disliked about the product: There are a lot of different categories that have to be done before you get traction. Not bad. Just time-consuming.

Review title: G2Crowd is an awesome company to partner with!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Their onboarding was thorough, efficient and effective!  We appreciate the quick replies to our questions and continuous support during our onboarding process.
What they disliked about the product: Traffic isn't directed to our website as well as Capterra.

What they liked about the product: This site is really great - we are getting a lot of benefits.  We have reviews coming in, we're getting leads and I'm validating where to focus on improving the product.  G2Crowd really works better than I expected!
What they disliked about the product: I'd have to defer to my Marketing Director  - but sales, customer success and product get a lot of value from what we hear real time.

Review title: Great team and clean process!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The minute we signed up we got full attention from the on-boarding team. Training was efficient, follow up were great and that led to awesome results. 
What they disliked about the product: I don't have much to this time. We have been on the platform for few weeks only. 

Review title: G2 Crowd basis your "standing" off Customer Reviews only- which is what a review site should do!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd's interface is easy to work with and is appealing to on both the company and client side. G2 Crowd basis your company standing off customer reviews only, which is exactly what a review site should do! No way to pay to get higher placement, if your customers are happy you will see your company's presence rise. 
What they disliked about the product: People can complete their reviews privately, although I think publically a person can be kept private, it would help the company out to find out who gives what review so we can either thank them or help them.

Review title: Seems like there's a lot of potential here
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Great analytics on the backend was unexpected. Also, they have really exceptional account reps and sales reps. I wasn't expecting the level of expertise and care I experienced. They also have some really amazing reports to help buyers compare rival software systems and the fact that every review is checked against the users LinkedIn account + a screenshot of them brings the review to a higher level of credibility. 
What they disliked about the product: The user interface is a little too cluttered. There seem to be some issues visual hierarchy. This makes it difficult for one to quickly understand the great reports they have to offer which is a shame. Also, this is minor, but the "chat here" option appears to often. It is common to have a chat icon in the bottom right of the screen but it's also repeated in several other areas of the site which makes the site feel to cluttered and too "salesy". I honestly believe more people would visit g2 if the user interface felt less cluttered.  

Review title: Great Support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd gives us an easy-to-use platform to host our customer reviews and generate reputable 3rd party content. 
What they disliked about the product: Content/reports are somewhat expensive for a startup to buy that will no longer be used after a year. 

Review title: Discover potential buyers and use a lot of great marketing assets 
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Great team, great support. The product is very intuitive for doing sales research. We have a team of 3 working on it. One person is responsible for analyzing the leads and searching for contact info, another person is doing the outbound campaigns, and the third person is working with marketing assets. 
What they disliked about the product: It would be great to have a more data on the prospects as well as a more comprehensive list of marketing assets and ways to use these assets. The bigger this library is the better it will serve the customers. 

Review title: Excellent Sales to Service
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: White glove treatment as we onboarded with the new product. They provided a ton of best practice documentation and case studies to help us get up to speed.
What they disliked about the product: nothing at the moment. We are still looking to measure ROI

Review title: Great way to generate reviews
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The review campaign generated more reviews that we'd ever had before, and we more than met our goals within the first few weeks.  Plus we generated valued customer feedback to action.
What they disliked about the product: Some of the lead capture analytics lacked the detail we would like, for example, which category listing generated the most view for us.

Review title: Awesome customer service
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I worked with Kelly throughout the on boarding process, and she was amazing. She cared as much about the campaign's success as we did, and made it super easy to get up and running on G2Crowd.
What they disliked about the product: I'd love if G2Crowd provided more specific insights about the people researching software (beyond company name and state).

Review title: Good Platform for the Right Audience
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Control over my profile and the ability to put custom marketing and branded content on our page
What they disliked about the product: Getting charged for free trial clicks regardless of quality of leads

Review title: G2 Is a Necessity for Business
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The best thing about G2 are the people who work their.  The customer support and success management teams are of the highest caliber and add truly strong and worthwhile value.  They are very responsive to questions or concerns and work tirelessly to meet business goals with their partners. As for the platform, some of the analytics are out of this world.  We are able to see companies who are looking at our listing and track them through our funnel.  It is a great addition to your SDR strategy and we rely heavily on it.
What they disliked about the product: While the content is beautiful and elicits interactions and views, It is very expensive.

Review title: Customer Advocacy is the New Demand Generation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd represent the unbiased, firsthand experience of software technology buyers and covers the entire IT and customer life cycle (product evaluation, implementation, ease of use, service, and customer support). It has become an integral part of our customer advocacy and client decision making process, and we have been able to successfully improve our brand positioning through end user experience.
What they disliked about the product: Lack of data connector within the premium package has limited us to evaluate customer journey between Salesforce and G2 Crowd. As a result, we have not been able to evaluate ROI goals from the platform. I would recommend the development to consider introducing support for data connectors like -  Salesforce, Google Analytics, AdRoll. Also, there should be a  customization support for the profile tailored to client needs. 

Review title: Attentive and quick to gain results! 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: When working with G2 Crowd, I really enjoyed the customer service I received in addition to the results. Anytime I had a question, I got an answer very quickly, that was friendly and offered further assistance. The team worked hard to ensure that we knew what their deals were, what our goals should be, and made sure we were all doing everything we could to reach our expectations.
What they disliked about the product: In the beginning, they wanted to move a little faster than we did. We're new to the review game and wanted time to assess, inform our team, and gather advice from others in our company. 

Review title: Outstanding personalized onboarding service
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The folks at G2Crowd are very engaging and involved through every step of the onboarding process.  The development of our product profile was carefully guided throughout the entire onboarding process.
What they disliked about the product: Regarding the onboarding process specifically, I don't really have any dislikes.  The attention to detail and involvement from the G2 team is a rarity among larger organizations today.

Review title: G2 Review Helped us Troubleshoot a Problem (and Create Success) for a Customer
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 helps us become aware of our strengths and our shortfalls so we know how our customers see us.  This knowledge is priceless!
What they disliked about the product: Not having enough time to use all the premium profile features! 

Review title: The ONLY Review Site We Invest In
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ease of use, all of the functionality, the campaigns we can run, and the reviews of course!
What they disliked about the product: We have to pay for a branded landing page.

Review title: G2 Crowd is Awesome
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I love the awareness G2 Crowd offers for our product. If someone is simply searching on Google for a CRM system, G2 Crowd pops up and offers all these products with REAL customer reviews. I think that is extremely valuable to both shoppers and companies. G2 Crowd gets hundreds to thousands of people scrolling through their site daily, which offers a great amount of awareness to our product.

One other thing I HAVE to praise is the G2 Crowd staff. Bliss Billingsley was incredibly helpful throughout our training/implementation phase and was always quick to email or call when I had questions. Just last week she transitioned us along to Ashley McDermott, our Relationship Manager. While I'm sad to no longer work with Bliss, I'm equally as excited to work with Ashley and improve our ranking even more!
What they disliked about the product: The only complaint I have is that they sent the review emails to our customers back to back. G2 Crowd sends 3 emails to notify your customers to leave reviews and earn gift cards, but I was really hoping we'd be offered the chance to choose the dates of these emails. They sent all 3 emails back to back over a 3 day period, which in my opinion wasn't enough space between emails. Maybe just give customers the option in the future of when to send the emails.
*Disclaimer: I may have had the option to choose and just forgot/didn't realize it...

Review title: Good place for information

Review title: We are winning customer engagements with G2Crowd
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The comparison module allows potential customers to compare your business services with those of your competitors. 
What they disliked about the product: The form is rather long :), and I believe that it impedes people from completing a full, accurate review.

Review title: Great Onboarding Experience & Results 
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Support is always there if needed, you get a devoted account rep and have direct access to ask questions. The onboarding process is smooth.
What they disliked about the product: The profile set up wasn't always completely intuitive, but with someone always available to answer questions that wasn't a barrier to getting it complete. 

Review title: G2 Crowd is the Future
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I like the ability to easily compare solutions through a variety of classifications, i.e. small-business, mid-market, enterprise. I also like that we are able to view who visits our page and track prospects from website visits to G2 Crowd visits. 
What they disliked about the product: I wish we were able to utilize ABM functionality and able to see our ranking on the quadrant. I also would like functionality around serving offers to people visiting our profile, i.e. proactive targeting based on a account list. 

Review title: Seamless!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team at G2Crowd are professional, responsive and are excellent communicators. They were able to customize specific requirements we had and tailor a program that works for us.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing so far. The platform and the team have been excellent.

Review title: One of the best B2B review platforms with excellent service
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is different from other popular review sites by focusing on unbiased user reviews and software rankings. I like the rankings – I believe the G2 Crowd's patented algorithms and methodologies result in accurate and adequate rankings and reports. 
I also like the grid system for every category – it gives a good visual overview. 
A bonus, the communication and support from the G2 Crowd's team has been excellent – they truly know what they are doing and want to provide their users with the best experiences. 
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing I would add here. The experience has been pleasant. 

Review title: Stephanie is awesome! She did a great job getting us on-boarded with G2 Crowd.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We like the ability to get in front of people searching for reviews of our product category. It's a great introduction to potential customers to showcase our product against others with reviews to differentiate us. 
What they disliked about the product: We wish we could have more than one default category. Otherwise, things have been pretty great!

Review title: Fantastic review profile platform! 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We love the ease of use within the platform and how easy it is for our clients to review us on our profile. 
What they disliked about the product: Currently there is nothing that we dislike about the G2 profile and system. 

Review title: Gain Brand Awareness, First Class Support!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd is a crucial part of our overall brand awareness in the industry and upwards growth. It's great to have critical feedback from users to share with our team as well as positive reviews to continue to solidify our mission and morale. 
We have also integrated a G2 Slack channel (through Zapier) which helps us see real-time tracked prospects. This allows us to communicate this action to sales which may help move the prospect through the pipeline. Our leads through G2 have picked up the more active we are with the site. 
The G2Crowd banner is also in the footer of our website, and this helps with additional validity for prospects considering a TMS in the space. 
Our CSM Jess has genuinely been an extension of our company and helps us strategize and sets us up for success with our account.
What they disliked about the product: There are not too many dislikes. We are enjoying the prospect scoring, but understand we can't get more visibility into this data without upgrading.  

Review title: Most reputable platform for "yelp style" reviews
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: - Being in an industry without a quadrant of wave, this platform gives our prospects a place to gauge a feel for their options and read reviews of peers
- Love the intelligence we get from the platform and the ability for prospects to engage with us and the reviews of our customers via widgets on our website and directly on G2Crowd
- Our success manager has been great at keeping us up to date with latest developments and the different ways to use the solution
What they disliked about the product: - I'd love to see even more granular data on who is visiting our category
- The navigation can be a little confusing on the backend, I find myself randomly clicking around the menu until I find what I was actually looking for.

Review title: Effective. Easy. Fast.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Not unlike setting up a new profile for a personal account, e.g. LinkedIn or Facebook, standing up a profile for your company is easy. There's a short checklist of items to "complete" your profile, et voila - you are done! 

I must also say the Account Executive with whom I worked on understanding this market and then ultimately purchasing the software was incredibly helpful and consultative. We just finished our implementation phase - which is funny given how easy it was to set up Implementations seems like an above-and-beyond service - and discovered we get to continue to work with our Account Executive. Happy about that.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to speak of here, despite looking for areas of potential concern!

Review title: Definitive review site for our market - helps level the playing field 
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Verification of reviewers as professionals and users is very important to the credibility of the results. 
What they disliked about the product: I'd like to be able to meter out the invitations sent to users over 4-6 months instead of a large set all at once. 

Review title: Great review collection experience
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd was incredibly accommodating of our just-in-time approach to planning and schedules; creative and willing to go the extra mile; and the people who staffed the event, Bobbi and Brittany, were the best ever.  It was an unexpected pleasure and success to work with two such energetic professional pleasant effective people - can't say enough about them!!!
What they disliked about the product: All I have to say is that there's nothing to dislike.

Review title: G2 = Great Stuff
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd is increasingly becoming a crucial part of our overall brand awareness and recognition of our empirical value in the industry. It’s critical for us to get detailed, first-hand, independent feedback from our customers that can be utilized by prospects and our internal sales and product teams as well.  

The vendor portal is very user friendly, and our account manager, George, has been helpful every step of the way. We recently launched a new review campaign, called G2 Gives, and we are excited by the idea of incentivizing customers and reviews with charity donations. 

Overall, G2 Crowd has already brought great value to our company and we are looking to expand the use of it over time.   

What they disliked about the product: There are so many useful features – there is not much to dislike.  And I think the vision and roadmap can take G2 to even broader value for us.  I guess the most difficult part is change management on our side – i.e. how do we get our teams to more habitually use the G2 features and information in all of our internal sales, marketing, support, and product processes.  

Review title: Higher quality leads with specific analysis on the competition
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is an ideal fit for fast-growing companies looking to increase market share with higher quality leads and better business intelligence. 
What they disliked about the product: Ability to target companies by annual revenue.

Review title: Great Vendor
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team is very helpful whenever we need anything. They are on top of everything every step of the way.
What they disliked about the product: Pricing seemed a bit high at first as we were unsure what that money invested was going to get us. But it is clear that they are experienced and we are now hoping to see a nice ROI from it. 

Review title: Smart Team w/ great advice

What they liked about the product: They knew which features were most important to us and focused time on those

What they disliked about the product: There are some manual things like Account Mapping and implementation that could be very time intensive on your sales op and/or end user. G2 is working on ways to improve work flows. Think about what playbooks to run with the data G2 can provide.

What they liked about the product: This is a real website, a real company, with real rewards. They are looking out for you and for the clients! The fact that they are trying to promote and put other companies with all kinds of software and products with honest reviews from us its awesome! 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really, they aren't even invasive. Pretty chill! 

Review title: Digital River MyCommerce Product Rating, Client Advocacy & Brand Awareness
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The support the G2 Crowd team has been incredible. Marty is so responsive and had really pushed us to adopt the proven strategies that have worked very well for other G2 Crowd clients. He's been right about everything and we're seeing very quick results and dramatic improvements to our grid ranking and success in obtain new customer reviews.  We are a global business so it's important to us that G2 Crowd is a global product review site -- we hear from prospects and global team members how important this platform is from across various regions in the ecommerce/subs/payment processing technology buying process.  Looking forward to expanding our efforts and further investment in this marketing channel.
What they disliked about the product: Our initial performance goals were around lead generation and brand visibility on the leader grids. Quite frankly, we weren't seeing any leads or any placement on the grid until we were able to obtain a lot of positive customer reviews, unfortunately 11 months into the annual contract. Now we have started to see some regular activity and great progress on the effectiveness.  The intent program is very expensive and it will be difficult to justify our ROI given our relatively low cost of acquisition needed for our ROI.  

Review title: Strategic part of go to market plan, easy to set up, great account teams, and valuable grid reports
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Setting up our company page was very straight forward with a robust list of capabilities, categories and detail to add.  At minimum these profile pages should be set up.

After being able to build up reviews in a relatively short period of time we then turned to utilizing the Grid Reports to help drive engagement/leads as well as establishing our place in the market. 

The Grid Reports were our #2 asset driving engagement and lead gen in our LinkedIn advertising program.
What they disliked about the product: The only area we would love to see some additional work, but I also know these updates are coming, are more API integrations with other marketing/display/social platforms. 

Review title: Excellent product with great analytics
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: 1. Buyer Intent Data - The detailed analytics with facilities to filter & sort companies by their employee size, location and views helps a lot to analyze the prospect's behavior.
2. The G2 Crowd on-boarding was seamless.
3. The platform is simple and user friendly.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing at this stage - Its a great product. 

Review title: Great Service Throughout the Onboarding Process
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: A smooth onboarding process by knowledgeable and friendly people. They were always available to help clarify some of the missing information we needed before upgrading.  
What they disliked about the product: Nothing major, If I would have to choose one thing, I would say the # of people I had to deal with from sales to onboarding process. 

Review title: New to G2 Crowd and have had a great experience so far
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The onboarding process one of the best I've experienced for a marketing solution. Our account manager and implementation specialist have been great and very responsive to questions over the past few months. We've also seen excellent results from our review campaign. 
What they disliked about the product: It can take a few tries to get used to all of the premium account features, but any questions we had were answered quickly. 

Review title: Solid review platform that's manageable and easy to implement
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Everything is straightforward and made as easy as possible with G2 Crowd. You provide the details about your product, they even help you source reviews from your customers to help build your profile. Their team is responsive and engaged in helping you achieve success as you define it for your organization. 
What they disliked about the product: The login process can be tricky at times as you have to get another email to login to the account. 

Review title: Easy to use + great team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We work with a very responsive, helpful team that consistently delivers on deadlines (even when we don't always return the favor) and guides us through efforts to gather reviews. Shout out to Andrew for his jovial persona on calls- he made G2Crowd my favorite vendor to check in with.
What they disliked about the product: As a demand-gen marketer with lead goals to hit, we were hoping to see more direct leads coming from our G2Crowd profile. While I don't doubt the broader value of the platform (and the exposed visitor data gives very clear evidence of a role it's playing in the buying process), it's tougher to assign value to that in a ROI focused environment at a large corp with established sales systems.

Review title: Easy. Fast. and increases brand awareness. 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Loved hearing what our users think about our product. Also a great resource to share with prospects. The G2 Crowd on-boarding team was great! They were very responsive and ready to help share best practices. 
What they disliked about the product: Not much. There are some things that aren't self service and we needed to go through support for. For example, the company bio (under the logo) was outdated and we couldn't change that ourselves.  

Review title: G2Crowd has done wonders for my Sales Career
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: One of my favorite parts about G2Crowd is the customer reviews. I send out customer reviews all the time during prospecting and booked a ton of meetings with industry proof. I also love that G2Crowd provides accurate and up to date proof that the software I'm selling is legit and used by so many. All the realtime feedback makes my job easier during the outbound prospecting grind. 
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing I don't like about G2Crowd!

Review title: Ultimate Name Drop

What they liked about the product: I direct prospects everyday to G2 Crowd.

Review title: Valuable Tool for Supporting Informed Buying Decisions

What they liked about the product: The validation of the reviews and the structure of the data capture provides informed decisions. 
What they disliked about the product: The weighting provided to marketshare obscures the raw user data.

Review title: Valuable Tool to Support Sales Efforts
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We have found the "Track Your Prospects" and "Buyer Intent" features to be particularly useful for our outbound sales efforts.

Also G2 Crowd handling the gift card fulfillment in an automated way, has made our life a lot easier.

Our implementation manager, Bliss was also very easy to work with and very responsive! 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing major comes to mind. 

Would like to be able to select more than one "owner" of the product admin, so appropriate people can get notified of new reviews. There is a workaround to this that we have figured out but the notifications get sent to a personal email address that is tied to LinkedIn account, instead of work email account which would be preferred.

Review title: Amazing event support!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I had a wonderful experience working with the G2 events team to gather reviews at one of our recent client events. We did the work to gather reviews ourselves but they sent us all the materials and facilitated everything smoothly. Kevin and the team were phenomenal - they shipped computers to the event as well as a beautiful sign with our branding. They helped us make everything a success! I would highly recommend! 
What they disliked about the product: Honestly, nothing bad to say at this time about the events team! It was a bit frustrating that the G2 review approvers rejected some reviews that were given by valid users and clients at the event for reasons that I do not understand but that is a different function. 

Review title: G2Crowd is democratizing trust and transparency for b2b buyers, and empowering sellers
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Nothing is more credible than actual user reviews, and g2c has become the destination for b2b software buyers to both educate themselves on categories (amidst lots of marketplace confusion) and understand which technology products are most likely to meet their needs.

As a seller, I love that i have such an incredible resource to direct my prospects to, and some of G2C's premium (paid) services are very unique and helpful. My favorites are:
-G2 being a lead source, in it of its self
-the buyer intent data (which organizations are passively or actively exploring our services) piped right into our Salesforce account records/reporting which help us activate conversations we might otherwise not
-the ability to create personalized landing pages of curated customer reviews for prospects, based on what concerns or use cases they have been outspoken about (adoption, implementation, onboarding etc.) 
What they disliked about the product: For the review landing pages, I'd like to be able to configure the order in which reviews show. More customization options, and ability to see views on the pages would be well received.

Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: - Buyer intent data: Having the ability to see who is currently viewing your page, comparing you with which other solution is a great way to find out momentum.
- Video reviews
- The grid: The better positioned on the grid, the more leads you will get. It is surprisingly how companies are nowadays shortlisting suppliers solely based on the grid. 
What they disliked about the product: Overall a great platform with great people behind it.
The only remark I have is that while giving a lot of feedback, it sometimes takes a while before things are actually happening. 
Would also like to see even more best practices from the Customer Success Team. 
Presence in Europe, however they are heavily investing in the European marketing going forward, which is a big plus for us.

Review title: Very good structured on-boarding process
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The on-boarding process is quite time consuming but due to a really step-by-step on-boarding process very easy. We received help and answers to our questions very fast and never got stuck without help.
What they disliked about the product: The backend interface is a little bit old school  and sometimes not very intuitive. We would also like to have more possibilities for rules based for the customer intent emails.

Review title: A greater understanding of how potential buyers are behaving
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Buyer intent data: This gives a great view on what potential buyers are looking for, what is important to them, and if we are in their sights. If not, we can adjust. It gives us a clear picture of the overall market and our vertical. 

Being able to see who we are being compared to most often also gives our sales team another piece of information that they can bring into sales opportunities. 

Review widgets: Highlighting review scores and reviews gives us an edge. We have spent years building a great reputation - and now it's easy for our customers to tell the world!

Our point of contact in G2 has changed a couple of times. That can spell disaster, but so far each one has been as good as the last and the transition has been seamless. 
What they disliked about the product: Some vendors shouldn't be in our category, the research team needs to look a little bit more closely.

Review title: Excellent onboarding process
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We recently sign-up to G2 Crowd and have been extremely impressed with their onboarding process. Their team is well-organized and highly responsive. It's certainly made a very positive impression and has given us ideas for how we can improve our own onboarding process at Qarrot.
What they disliked about the product: So far, we're extremely satisfied with our entire G2 Crowd experience.

Review title: No One Collects More Trustworthy Reviews Than G2 Crowd! Easy to Implement and Use!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We really enjoy the G2 Crowd Grid that displays ClockShark alongside other similar time tracking software. Not only is it easy to see how our position changes as we collect more reviews, but this Grid can be embedded in marketing pages to provide leads with a real-time grid view. 

We also really love working with the team at G2 Crowd. Danny took extreme care to understand our company needs and expectations, and even sent us a signed "thank-you" note after our first webinar. (Who does this? Uhm...Danny does!) Our implementation specialist Kelly slowly and meticulously explained how to get our listing set-up. She transformed a super daunting job into very easy subtasks, and weekly met with us to review our progress. It was like eating an elephant, one bite at a time...but with less mandible engagement. Ashley, our main point of contact at G2 Crowd, has overseen our entire G2 Crowd journey, and is quick to resolve any concerns we have. Like, greased lightning fast!
What they disliked about the product: I have no complaints about the product, staff, or service at G2 Crowd. One observation is that G2 Crowd prizes quality reviews, and there can sometimes be a delay between review date and the day it posts to your account. Don't wig out: It's TOTALLY normal! They will carefully vet all reviews to make sure they are being submitted by actual software users. Fake news, fake reviews, Pokemon -- the team at G2 Crowd catches it all. 

Review title: Great social proof, great support. 
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: In addition to helping us differentiate our products from our competitors, G2 Crowd provides authentic, trusted social proof for buyers researching products. If a consumer searches for reviews of our products, G2C is the first thing they see. The badges, Grid and reference pages are great for sales enablement. 

Our EAM and CSM are amazing and always quick to respond, jump on a call, or meet with our stakeholders to ensure we're getting the most out of our subscription. They're willing to do some leg work for us whenever needed (I ask a lot of questions and tend to be a bit of a squeaky wheel). 
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes the algorithm will prioritize reviews that are neither recent or the most helpful, because they're verified or lengthy, but doesn't take context into consideration. 

Major increase in subscription price this year, but comes with a lot more functionality and tools to leverage (that we're still getting acquainted with).  High cost for SMBs, but so valuable.

Review title: Easy onboarding
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: There is constant communication during the onboarding process, so that when questions arise, they are answered and resolved quickly. 
What they disliked about the product: As someone being onboarded, there could be more clarity with the pricing and what you get with that pricing. Because of this, talks of up-selling happen from the beginning, which lends to confusion. 

Review title: #1 Customer Service and Expert in their space
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Everything from the sales process, to the on-boading and on-going customer support at G2 Crowd is on point! Kudos to Kristina for always going above and beyond in working with us. We are learning everyday on how to use G2 Crowd features to better improve our funnel and conversion. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing that I dislike right now. The product has also come a long way compared to one year ago. 

Review title: G2Crowd Buyer Intent Signals Created Pipeline for us
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Metadata has experienced phenomenal success with buyer intent data from G2Crowd. The way we operationalize the data is two ways:

1 - Outbound emailing particular personas within accounts visiting our page/category section, using the attributes provided by G2Crowd as a way to personalize the email.

2 - Execute account-based advertising campaigns (using metadata.io), targeting the right personas within those exact accounts with personalized content.

Within the first month of running these operations, metadata.io has generated a clear ROI for our investment that revived a lost opportunity into CLOSED WON opportunity, closed an additional new new deal (6-figure deal), and generated dozens of opt-in leads/conversions from those accounts visiting our category page, our competitors page or our own page on G2Crowd. All from the first month.


What they disliked about the product: The process of pushing the accounts from G2Crowd to an automated advertising campaign via social and programmatic channels is done with CSV files, but it's solvable using Zapier. Would be happy to see an integration between the two solutions, as well as others (e.g. outreach.io)

Review title: Good, but little presence within Australia
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Great gift card review scheme, the customer service and implementation was smooth and very prompt.
What they disliked about the product: Very little traffic within Australia/NZ. Not seeing ROI, yet.

Review title: Great service, intuitive product!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Firstly the team (of those I have been introduced to), have been super pleasant and helpful - and have make the onboarding process nice and easy, as well as getting us started ASAP with the reviews campaigns, as well as catering to the time difference!
The tool is very cool, with some of my favorites features for marketing being the reviews widgets, and the analytics of our profile.
From a sales perspective, the buyer intent features are extremely useful for our outbound sales strategy! 
What they disliked about the product: Although I understand there's a lot of features to cram in (there's no denying there's lots of cool things) I have found the interface a little unfriendly/buggy at times, however the latest layout is a big improvement - a tour/new tool guide would have been nice tho ;)
Other than that, it's a great system, and although just getting starting, I look forward to the results it will bring in the future!

Review title: Must have for modern B2B sales
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like the fact G2 Crowd is disrupting the old, stale way of running market evaluations of solutions. They crowdsource it from the users which is what I believe buyers are looking for throughout their purchase decision. As a sales rep, I can leverage the voice of our customer to address questions, objections, and similar initiatives with our active sales cycles. In a world of SaaS solutions, the voice of the customer is paramount. What I like best is the unique access to engage with prospects that are in a research phase by providing unfiltered perspective from our customers. 
What they disliked about the product: Not much to dislike technically. I would be interested in getting more analytics on which reviews visitor traffic is reading most. 

Review title: Great way to collect reviews and references
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 Crowd platform has provided a simple, efficient way to collect customer reviews and references, saving our team time and adding value to our marketing and sales efforts. The G2 Crowd team is very responsive and helpful, and their onboarding process was well organized.
What they disliked about the product: The platform interface is not as intuitive as I would expect, and it is sometimes difficult to find what I'm looking for or to switch from consumer view to admin view.

Review title: Amazing Client Success!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crows is easy to use and gives us the information we are looking for from our clients. I am also able to respond to our clients directly and personally. 

Most importantly, their people rock! I asked our CSM Kylie to help us find some information we were looking for and she went above and beyond to get it for us. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing from my experience. They are great to work with!

Review title: Valuable customer insights + great collateral for sales/marketing
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like that there are so many ways we can use G2Crowd. We use it for brand exposure, sales/marketing collateral, lead generation, outbound sales and more. Really easy to use and it's important to us that rankings are based on actual customer reviews instead of just paying to play like some other services.
What they disliked about the product: An easier way to get buyer intent data into our other systems such as Salesforce. That would make it easier for us to do ABM.

Review title: Awesome and Effective Solution for Review Generation
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Love how turn-key things have been thus far, as well as the attitude of the G2 crowd team (shoutout Mike, Pete, and Walter). These guys are on top of it. We just finished up our first review campaign and more than doubled our number of reviews (80+ new reviews), which we can now use to inform new product features and make improvements all around going into the new year. Best part—it was wildly simple to set up and launch.
What they disliked about the product: G2 Crowd obviously has a strong interest—like any tech company—in ensuring we become heavily integrated within their platform and remain customers for the foreseeable future. A few times that's come across just a little too strong, at least to our liking (lots of communications and calls to set up integrations we don't necessarily need on our end at the moment). Not really a deal breaker but we're a small, bootstrapped team that just needs a bit of consideration for what we can do at a reasonable pace. Other than that, not much to dislike about this platform and their team.

Review title: peer reviews with customized support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The onboarding was fantastic! No feature left unexplained, and nothing too skimmed over - everything had a time, sequence and clear and understandable process.
What they disliked about the product: It seems like there is a lot of investment of time upfront, but it's well worth it. Also, to get G2 working for you, a campaign must get going ASAP, which can be overwhelming, but helpful.

Review title: Data You Can Use
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: 1. For our use case, 80% of the traffic was net new.
2. Of the 20% we already had, a significant correlation was present to opportunities which shows value in the remaining 80%. This is continuing to test out positively.
3. The total traffic was way too much to use (1k+ unique companies every few months with conversion rates below 2%), but thankfully you can see exactly what each company is looking at. Sorting unique hits by page type, and then seeing which page types correlates to opportunities, allows me to handpick a workable amount of net new Leads to deliver to my sales team which convert at a forecast of over 12% (average). Not bad for Leads we haven't even touched!
What they disliked about the product: My biggest hurtle with G2 was the Leads integration. I was told I "could get the data any way I wanted" prior to buying. When installing, and realizing it was missing this key feature, I pinged the team. They're still a little young, and therefore overpromised. 

However, this turned out to be a very positive experience, because they designed and implemented a new API specific to my needs, and fast. Turns out they could get it to me any way I wanted, I just had to wait a few weeks. I now have a Leads API that gets me the data, how and when I need it. They're already listening to the next product advancements, and I feel confident the product will continue to grow beyond its existing value, which is already at this point quite significant.

The team was fast, effective, and easy to work with during the update; Couldn't be happier. G2 boyscout here, if you're charged with Demand Generation, Lead Generation, Scoring, or most anything relevant with Leads - there's a way for you to leverage this data and get value by the boat load.

Review title: Great onboarding & quick responses
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Our onboarding specialist and account manager are always quick to respond and answer all of our questions. They made it extremely easy to increase our review volume. 
What they disliked about the product: Currently, I don't have anything that I dislike. The analytics could be slightly improved (as far as deeper customization) but it works as is.

Review title: Helpful Customer Success Team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The Customer Success Team has been so helpful in getting us up and running quickly.  We were able to immediately begin seeing an ROI on our investment thanks to their ability to help us run a Review campaign.
What they disliked about the product: With any growing company, it seems that there are a lot of new employees that are still finding their way.  Fortunately they seem to have a strong core team that is helping guide them.

Review title: Great experience with G2 Crowd!

What they liked about the product: Being able to easily communicate with the team at G2 Crowd has been great. Whether by phone or email  Kelly and Noah were extremely easy to reach and knowledgeable if we had any questions.
What they disliked about the product: No complaints or dislikes about G2 Crowd. We've experienced nothing but great service!

Review title: Onboarding Feedback

What they liked about the product: The onboarding process was super smooth. Kristina Bradley did a wonderful job. She was able to connect really well with me and she made the whole journey absolutely educative.
What they disliked about the product: A fortnightly meeting with the Account Manager after the onboarding process would be really appreciative.

Review title: Onboarding with G2 Crowd
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: My onboarding team of Gabe Richardson, Peter Staunton and Luke Rastetter has made my first month with G2 the best experience I have ever received from a vendor.
What they disliked about the product: There is not one thing I can honestly say that I have disliked. My questions/concerns have always been answered immediately day or night.

Review title: Great Overall Experience
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Responsive team and very helpful staff members. I worked with Kelly and Duncan and what I really appreciate is that they're more focused on your growth instead of upselling random products (which most other companies like Capterra would do, a general solution). I would highly recommend G2crowd to anyone looking for genuine brand building platform and reaching out to a broader and more relevant audience.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing yet, except that sometimes the system in itself may seem a little confusing. However, with the help of the staff everything falls into place, so no complaints. One thing they can improve is lead management screen. We don't work on leads, and if it was possible to customize the solution a little bit more to suit individual requirements, it will be appreciated.

Review title: Collect Customer Feedback. Generate Leads. Accelerate Sales Process.
Rating: 5.0

What they disliked about the product: Honestly, there is nothing I disliked. The user interface of the application and the onboarding process are great.

Review title: Buying signals for personal targeting.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Outside of a direct request for information, I love the insight into what products or service a target account is looking at, before, during, and after the selling process. I primarily use the buying signals to decide which company to reach out to and which team to reach out to based on buying behavior, but I also use the signals for retention purposes. Knowing my accounts are looking at other products lets me know to reach out before they become a churn risk.
What they disliked about the product: I wish there were more information about WHO is looking.

Review title: Well Put Together Review Site Offering Many Options
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd offers a nice level of customization for our profile page and gives us ample opportunity to gain traction on the category page.
What they disliked about the product: I have not used G2 Crowd for very long, so far I have not encountered anything that I dislike. The service has been as advertised for me.

Review title: Great Experience
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The team at G2 Crowd is very organized and excited to ensure you succeed. They've worked diligently with us right from the start and within the first two weeks already made some serious moves. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike so far, we've been happy with our progress. 

Review title: Great place to gather reviews
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: We like that our customers can provide reviews in either an anonymous or identified way, and that as a visitor to the page, I can sort reviews based on star rating, industry, etc.  We love the real-time comparison grid and other ratings.  We also like that you can link to a specific review.  Other sites like Capterra, do not have this feature. 
What they disliked about the product: We had expected to receive more form-fill leads from our profile listings on G2 Crowd. 

Review title: A true source of peace of mind for prospects & customers
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team at G2 helped us reach our main goal: to let the world know that we have lots of customers that are truly enthusiastic about our products. We needed a dependable, trusted platform for those voices to be heard, and G2 helped us run a series of campaigns that resulted in over 100 reviews written about our product in just a few months.
What they disliked about the product: Some of the most advanced features require plans that are a bit pricey for a startup :-)

Review title: The best site to aggregate reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team at G2crowd is great. They offer a suite of products that really help the buyer get informed.
What they disliked about the product: nothing so far.  have been very happy with the overall experience.

Review title: G2 Crowd Gives Our Customers a Voice
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: How easy it is to communicate our needs to our representatives. The customer service has been great and we hit our goals using their methodology.
What they disliked about the product: We wish that the widgets for our website were more customizable. Just like I am filling out what I don't like (which is hard to come up with when you like a product like G2 Crowd :) ), our customers are asked to do the same. While the feedback is valuable, it shows on the widgets that you would use to promote reviews. Definitely workarounds, but one way they could improve!

Review title: The Go To Source for Real Reviews of Software Solutions
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Allows for smaller vendors without extra millions of dollars to gain visibility and compete against the bigger players based on functional reviews by real users. 
What they disliked about the product: Don't love the G2Crowd score and how it impacts total vendor scoring but understand the reasoning behind it

Review title: Best Marketing Spend So Far This Year
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2Crowd has been fast and easy to implement. The system is intuitive and we've gotten great results from review campaigns.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing so far. G2Crowd is a little pricey compared to competitors, but it's been well worth it.

Review title: Helped our Brand
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 asks the questions that elicit the answers that are useful to prospects in the buying process. As a result our customers address concerns that are common during the process that aren't uniquely covered in our conversations.
What they disliked about the product: It can be a little unclear how close you are (mathematically/algorithmically) to the next star (or tenth of a star).

Review title: Best Support and Onboarding Experience Ever!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The team at G2 Crowd is simply the best.  At the beginning of the process, there was a lot of information that was needed and it seemed like it was going to be an overwhelming project. However, the on-boarding team takes their time with you.  They schedule a series of calls to review what is needed and how to complete each step of the process. The best part is that they follow up with detailed instructions after every call, so if you missed something, you have it in writing as a reference. 
What they disliked about the product: I haven't found anything to dislike about G2 Crowd - the team or the product - at this point. 

Review title: Informative and Actionable Onboarding
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I liked the onboarding process of the G2 Crowd marketing solution. Everything was explained in detail with the right touch points and follow-ups. 
What they disliked about the product: The tool has an opportunity to offer further customizations on the display of the profile. I hope in the future these customization options are available.

Review title: Provides tools for succeeding and smooth on-boarding
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The implementation specialist made sure the on-boarding process was thorough, yet simple, and has overall been incredibly helpful and responsive. The platform surprised me with some tools I wasn't aware of, like reference pages and crowd quotes. Verified customer review and incentivized review campaigns are features worth mentioning as well.
What they disliked about the product: No negatives so far, looking forward to improve and develop our implementation further. 

Review title: Excellent on-boarding service

What they liked about the product: Onboarding team was very attentive to details and results oriented. They shared a lot of best practices and provided valuable advice and support.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really to complain about. Great process overall.

Review title: Solid platform with excellent site features and customer service
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The personal touch from account reps and teams was amazing from day one. They were super helpful and proactively walked me through the process of getting started and figuring out my questions. The website is by far one of the best websites I've used for admin and features. Love the website and it's the poster-child for usability, tooltips and being well organized. 
What they disliked about the product: We're really not seeing much as far as leads or traction from the platform as we'd like, but I was warned that G2 is not a big lead generating platform. We hope that the reviews are helping to feed other organic channels, but we'll never really know. I also don't like that they cap the amount of leads they're willing to give you each year, even though extra leads might be coming in. That sounds silly. But, my problem is getting even close to that number to begin with.

Review title: Great Service for Reviews & More
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The assistance provided in understanding the review space, how the space works, and how our brand can benefit was great.  Our team was first-class and ready to please. The reviews we received have become quite helpful for our sales team and also our product dev teams. Also, the lead generation program can also prove to be beneficial for some companies. UI redesign has also come along quite nicely. 
What they disliked about the product: As with any young company, there have been minor tech hiccups along the way. Nothing that required a huge undertaking, but just a little patience for the growing pains. Many pricing tiers for data and content can be mystifying as well.

What they disliked about the product: There were a few hiccups along with way with getting our initial email out due to email issues on their end that could have been communicated a little better; however, in the end, all ended up working out fine.

Review title: We've increased our reviews

What they liked about the product: The team at G2 is great. They really helped us create a review campaign that worked well for our relationship with our customers. They answered all of our questions and got us the data that we need.

Review title: Had a great onboarding experience!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Appreciated our representatives' thorough and speedy answers to our questions. The walk-throughs were always pleasant and informative. Big shout-out to our implementation specialist Peter who held our hands through the whole process. We've been pleasantly surprised by the depth of both the platform and the enablement flow. Everyone on the G2 side has also been refreshingly transparent about their capabilities and their roadmap.
What they disliked about the product: Barring a few bugs in the reference sheets tool, G2 has delivered so far on everything we've been promised. Not much to talk about in the realm of dislikes.

Review title: Great intent signals
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We like the intent signals that we see when companies search for us or our category. On-boarding was great and our account rep was excellent, patient and helpful. 
What they disliked about the product: the interfaces is a little "homebrew" - getting to admin center is a little clunky. Price performance is still a bit of a question particularly in the long-term.

Review title: Giving it a 10 because I can't rate it any higher
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is an essential part of our sales process. The buyer intent notifications are awesome in helping us identify warm leads to reach out to.

Once they're in an evaluation with us, we direct them to the grids we're on as well our product page itself. This is HUGE in establish credibility. Potential buyers are able to see real, validated third-party reviews so they know their peers think we're as awesome as we say we are.
What they disliked about the product: Buyer intent notifications are sent once every day at 5pm, and it's my understanding this cannot be changed. 

It'd be nice if I were able to customize the time and frequency at which I receive these reports.

Review title: Cutting through the noise
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: In the last 12 months, our Salesforce CPQ Grid position has been my go-to slide for demonstrating our customer’s success with prospects. It’s one thing to deliver the company talk track around ease of use, speed, and functionality -- it’s another to reinforce the story with authentic G2 reviews that are collected from users just like them. 

As a best practice, I strongly recommend leveraging G2 reviews to authenticate your sales conversations. The market we work in can get extremely competitive and it’s important to cut through the noise, quickly. I do this by sending prospects to a reputable source of truth on how users are getting value from what we provide. 
 

What they disliked about the product: The fact that I can't actually see the contact details of the people reviewing our pages

Review title: Superb Customer Service & Excellent Solution for Buyer Intent 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team at G2 Crowd are clearly passionate about their clients success. From our initial conversations right through onboarding and beyond the team have been invested in making our campaign a success. The buyer intent data is excellent and really helps to focus our marketing efforts towards active buyers. The Review Campaign was a great success and helped us to understand where we are strong and weak from a product point of view. 
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike about the G2 Platform 

Review title: Customer Reviews reveal potential reference and referral customers
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to find new promotors though the review information. We use it to review other software tools and companies we are considering partnering with.
What they disliked about the product: The review list does not always include the customer's name and the list of customer reviews cannot be exported even as an admin on the account.

Review title: Customer Support is Great
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I had to contact customer support about a problem with a gift card. Eric quickly resolved the problem.

Then I asked him to change the email sent to reviewers to prevent the problem in the future. He then forwarded the issue to the product support team to improve G2 so that others can have a better experience.
What they disliked about the product: I do not really dislike anything right now.

Review title: Great support service!

What they liked about the product: Great support from managers with launch and execution. Very appreciated
What they disliked about the product: Didn't notice any, everything was great 

Review title: Third-Party Validation You Can't Get Anywhere Else
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: What I like best about G2 is that we're able to leverage our happy customers as a competitive advantage in sales cycles. Using G2, we can show our prospects a side-by-side comparison of how satisfied our customers are against each of our major competitors. These quantitative metrics have made a huge difference for us.
What they disliked about the product: Overall, I like the way G2 looks at markets, but the way that G2 calculates "Market Presence"— the Y-axis in Grid Reports — could use some improvement. It uses 15 factors like Number of Employees, Revenue, Web Presence, and  Social Presence. This gives large companies with hundreds of products and thousands of employees a distinct advantage over specialists that are better known in a given market. Companies like IBM and Microsoft will always score well in Market Presence because of their sheer size, even if they have only a handful of employees working on a given product.

What they liked about the product: Working with the G2 Crowd team has been a pleasure. They are very organized and make the relationship feel like a true partnership.
What they disliked about the product: We have had a few hiccups in rolling out our reviews campaign (landing pages with the wrong review incentive were sent out initially) but they have always been resolved quickly and with transparency from the G2 team. Even with the hiccups, we got a great response to our campaign and are happy with our on-boarding.

Review title: Great Experience, Knowledgeable and Helpful Team 
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The team tailored onboarding to my particular needs - it never felt too slow or too rushed. Now that our product is up and running, I feel confident our G2 reviews are helping us to win in our category. 
What they disliked about the product: I don't know that there is much to dislike - the product is pretty straightforward from a management perspective. The one aspect I would change is to have more flexibility in on the 'calls to action' on our page. Our product is unique in that its free to use, so anything that speaks to a 'free trial' feels misleading for potential customers or our offering. 

Review title: G2Crowd is authentic great advice that we trust and use regularly.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Authentic reviews, great comparison content, and a great team to work with day to day. We use G2Crowd when reviewing software as well as a platform where we encourage agencies to review our platform. Everything about G2Crows is quality.
What they disliked about the product: The lead generation that results from G2Crowd is so high quality that I just wish we could get more volume. The low funnel lead generation from G2Crowd is top notch.

Review title: Great experience so far!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The onboarding process has been thorough and well executed. I liked how they break it up over several calls, giving you time to implement what we went over in between calls and also avoiding a firehose of information and features to try to remember all in one onboarding call.
What they disliked about the product: Just like most enterprise tools like this, it can be complicated and is a lot of information to digest. Luckily the support and onboarding team has been really helpful.

Review title: Outstanding product, customer service.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Love how easy it was to get our product to get some visibility and traction in the marketplace among peers in the same category. Our account manager  and implementation folks were awesome and guided us every step of the way. 
What they disliked about the product: Didn’t know about some cool features till our account manager told us. Some of our customers have reported issues with review submission failures multiple times. Just the submit button was not working. 

Review title: Lots of Data
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 provides so much data that organizations can use to drive sales and retain customers. They offer trusted reviews, buyer insights data, competitive insights data, reports, and more. 
What they disliked about the product: G2 moves really fast and sometimes doesn't tell all the Account Managers what new products are being launched. Sometimes, I wished they slowed down a little bit. There is such a thing as too much data. Also, they are very, very expensive for vendors. 

Review title: worked with the G2 team to get buyer intent leads

What they liked about the product: The team is the best thing about them - helpful and professional
What they disliked about the product: Extracting the information about each lead / company isn't as easy as I'd expect

Review title: Amazing team! The best 3rd party validation platform for B2B companies, period.  
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: It is a great tool for
1. It is the best 3rd party validation platform for software companies
2. Badge system which can easily be implemented on the website
3. Verified Customer reviews
4. Huge user base and most of our customers are familiar with it
5. Great support team
6. Dedicated chatbot category which most vendors seem to lag
7. benchmarking against competitors (it shows how we compete and how we are better than our competitors) 

What they disliked about the product: There was an issue with the banner and badges not being updated properly or on time. Changes are often not saved in the platform. A lot of great features but are available for additional charges. Integrations with platforms such as HubSpot are not as straight forward. Takes some getting used to in using the platform.  

Review title: Innovative marketing solution for software vendors
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Profile & review management is straightforward, content widgets are user-friendly, integrations with other platforms are powerful and the G2 team is very supportive (hats off to Kelly & Laura).
What they disliked about the product: Price points are pretty high, and plan tiers upgrades are pretty steep, which prevents us from making the most of the platform. Also, it would be really nice to be able to export more data from our profile.

Review title: Great Platform for Collecting Reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It was seamless to get up and running with G2 Crowd.  Ali was essential in helping us figure out a game plan to increase our presence on this site and listened to the approach that we wanted to take.  I loved that we could have unique landing pages for our CS team to track inbound reviews and our customers seemed more open to posting reviews knowing they could post anonymously. I also really like being able to customize a reference page that we can keep relevant with recent reviews so that our sales team can leverage this in their conversations.  Having a personal dashboard where you can track all reviews, their status on posting as well as the reward payout is also a plus.
What they disliked about the product: Some of our customers did express some frustration with getting the reviews to post, but it most likely was due to user error (not completing email verification or wanting to connect via LinkedIn).  While we did try and coach customers through this, some were not willing to take these additional steps and in turn, caused the reviews not to be posted.  There also was not an exact match for our industry within the drop down list, so sometimes our customers were unsure how to correctly complete all fields that were required.

Review title: Good Platform, Great Support Team!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 admin portals are intuitive and easy to use so as an admin, I can find the insights I need without breaking a sweat. That said, the Success and Support teams have been what makes G2 really stand out. There is always a responsive person available to help brainstorm, troubleshoot, or point our program in the right direction. 
What they disliked about the product: Platform functionality is highly limited depending on the package purchased. Some features that are truly standard to operate basic review programs seem to only be included in optimized or enhanced packages. It's frustrating to design a program around these limitations and when this is brought up, the only real solution is up-sell - which is not a realistic option for many. 

Review title: A strong partner for lead generation and elevating our brand 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: As a global company, its invaluable for us that G2 are able to accept online reviews in local language as we solicit reviews from our customers around the globe.  As a leader in the review space G2 is known in all the regions we operate with them making them a truly global partner.  They have played a huge part in accelerating our pipeline through leads generated off the back of reviews and more recently offered an excellent service at our industry event where they gathered 200+ reviews (on a target of 100!)  
What they disliked about the product: The ability to tag and pull reviews off the G2 site for use in broader marketing campaigns is a little clunkier than some of their competitors but I believe there are new plans in place for this, so I look forward to the updates on this.

Review title: The value of peer reviews
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The B2B market is now looking at peer review sites, like G2, as an important source for truly independent perspectives from real customers about the experience they are having with our platform and services. We think this is a growing trend in the customer service industry and we leverage the findings constantly to help us improve the products and services we deliver. G2 is one of the top vendors in this space. 
What they disliked about the product: It is important to get enough depth in a review to make it actionable and we don't always get that. Further, we'd like to see more G2 visibility in search results relevant to our call/contact center industry so that our customers and prospects can leverage in their buying research. 

Review title: Exceptional Review Site Support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd has helped provide us with a platform that our customers can truly voice their opinions about Genesys. This has become a great tool for our company internally and allows a great platform for potential prospects to use. G2 went above and beyond at our recent customer event by helping us collect reviews and we were able to collect over 250 reviews in 2 days. 

G2 helped us pivot quickly during the pandemic when in-person events were canceled, and we were able to come up with unique ways to continue to collect reviews.
What they disliked about the product: The backend of G2 is currently improving for the admin use however there could still be some more room for improvement in regards to tagging reviews. Also it would be nice to be able to create our own unique tracking links for events and campaigns instead of having to go to G2 support every time.

What they liked about the product: The team at G2, everyone who I've interacted with have been very proactive in helping us achieve our goals.

The technology is very helpful in understand which leads and accounts to prioritize.
What they disliked about the product: There is an incentive of $25 to generate reviews, but perhaps some consultation/suggestions on how many gift cards to use would have been helpful.

Review title: ﻿Usando G2crowd por 1 ano agora
Rating: 3.0
What they liked about the product: ﻿- Dados de intenção do comprador Pedi ao nosso CSM Kylie para nos ajudar a encontrar algumas informações que estávamos procurando e ela foi além para obter isso para nós Nosso especialista em integração e gerente de contas estão sempre prontos para responder e responder a todas as nossas perguntas. Disposto a fazer algum trabalho de perna para nós sempre que necessário eu faço um monte de perguntas e tendem a ser um pouco de uma roda estridente
What they disliked about the product: ﻿Nada da minha experiência Às vezes, o algoritmo priorizará revisões que não são recentes nem mais úteis, porque são verificadas ou demoradas, mas não levam em consideração o contexto O processo de empurrar as contas do G2Crowd para uma campanha de publicidade automatizada via social e canais programáticos são feitos com arquivos CSV, mas é solucionável usando Zapier Como alguém sendo incorporado, pode haver mais clareza com os preços e o que você ganha com esse preço

Review title: G2 Crowd is a great review site and easy to navigate as an admin

What they liked about the product: Easy to edit product profile
Ability to run review campaigns and extend gift cards to clients
Buyer intent functionality is popular across sales and account management
Dashboard to see activity at a glance
Acquire new references when clients write review and opt in to learn more
Easy to create custom online reference pages
Our contacts including Kylie Foo and Brett Butterfield are great! Kylie is a very reliable CSM. She is smart, knowledgeable, super friendly, and responsive. 
What they disliked about the product: I plan to ask our CSM, but I don't believe there is a good way for us to share the positive comments from reviews on our website. They do have the review snapshot widget, but it is not very configurable i.e. it doesn't really work on our website. Thus, we are not able to share the good review using them as social proof on our site.

Review title: Amazing Support Team! 
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I enjoyed collaborating with the G2 team as an on-going basis. They are very supportive and helpful. They want us to succeed so they follow-up quite often. When I have questions, they always reply in a prompt manner!

As for the G2 platform itself, it is very simple and easy to use. The analytics are very helpful for our marketing strategy for our customer retention and reaching out to new opportunities. It offers a lot of different options to promote our organization onto the G2 page.     
What they disliked about the product: The only downside about G2 is the Buyer Intent "recommended leads". Thus far, we haven't had much luck reaching out to the right person. 

Review title: Perfect and unbiased partner
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Our partnership with G2 helps us to showcase the experience our clients have with iDeals. This way more potential clients can feel confident when choosing iDeals as their VDR provider. We've already seen a spike of interest toward iDeals page and we now have more reviews coming in.
What they disliked about the product: Not much. The platform is more or less straightforward and onboarding helps too

Review title: Great onboarding process
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: As new to G2, I found the established on boarding process to be superb (and something our business can learn from), The key touch points are sequenced to match our experience and progression through the product and I found that every time we had a series of questions (after doing some of the work), the next G2 meeting was around the corner.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing so far...we are early in the process.

Review title: Director of Community
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I enjoyed working with the G2 team. They were very responsive, willing to help and worked to create a seamless process for us. We got a lot done in a short amount of time because of their work.
What they disliked about the product: I can't think of a specific downside for us personally, but I would caution people to consider G2 only when you have the time, energy and resources to commit to it. I thought our process went quickly because (1) the G2 team stayed on top of everything and (2) because we were committed to the process. I would advise teams to have a point person and champion for it in their organization.

Review title: Excellent Product and Superior Service
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: My company had been using the free version of G2 and had maxed out its capabilities. We investigated a paid version and the rep I spoke with was personable, informative, and fantastic. He helped us through the entire process and made it easy for us to make the decision to pay for G2. I never felt pushed or treated unfairly, and they went out of their way to give us a great experience.
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing I can think of that I disliked.

Review title: A great way to boost visibility
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to get great reviews quickly. We went from 2 reviews to 34 within the first few weeks of joining G2. The platform is really easy to use in general so far. 
What they disliked about the product: No strong dislikes so far with the platform 

Review title: Increased Reviews in One Campaign 
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I like how G2 runs the first campaign to get the profile off and running. We increased reviews by a few hundred percents from where we started in just one campaign. 
What they disliked about the product: Dislike the tasking process of verifying a review. There were a few reviews we felt were legitimate however, were rejected because they were not able to verify they were a customer. 

Review title: An insanely smooth on-boarding process 
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: * We can see our recent activity at a glance in the dashboard. 

* The UI is clear so we have visibility into our reviews and profile, and we're able to see how we can use the information collected. 

* Our on-boarding specialist and CSM have been incredibly responsive and knowledgeable. They've made the entire process easy. 

* We can use our user reviews as social proof in our sales cycle 


What they disliked about the product: While I understand the need, the review validation process has been a bit frustrating. There have been several reviews that I read prior to their validation that were clearly Sharpen users, but they were rejected because of an error in their user validation. It seemed that only those who reviewed and validated their identity via LinkedIn were able to actually be validated. Email address validation was not as reliable. 

Review title: Overall, a really good onboarding experience
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Kelly did a great job acting on our behalf. When we bumped into an issue between a G2 process and a detail of our product, she helped find a quick resolution and kept things on track. Communication was clear, timely and consistent.
What they disliked about the product: The G2 verification process is a bit mysterious, but again Kelly stepped us through things nicely. She answered questions as she could, and found answers when she needed to.

Review title: Arms my team to compete in the new era of sales!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: B2B Sales is changing.  The buyer controls the process and there is so much information online.  On top of that, there are more distractions for the modern seller than ever before.  Buyer intent data helps my team focus on the right companies that are in the market for what we offer.  It's a life saver!!
What they disliked about the product: As they continue to improve the Salesforce integration we'll become more efficient at getting this information to the right reps.  

Review title: Great onboarding experience with Kelly!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Kelly was such a joy to work with. Our on-boarding experience was very seamless and much of it had to do with Kelly's willingness to coach us throughout the process. She stayed on top of things and was always eager and willing to hop on a call. We appreciated her detailed recaps and it was great to see the progress we've made since implementation. 

I also like the UI/UX - the platform is also very intuitive and easy to use. 
What they disliked about the product: I can't think of any downsides at the moment. A true measure of success for us will be the number of MQLs/SQLs we are able to create from this platform. TBD.

What they liked about the product: I really have enjoyed working with the team at G2. They make the onboarding process very easy, provide a lot of useful information and are there when you need help. The G2 platform is very easy-to-use and it's a great way to leverage valuable customer feedback. 

We aim to look at Buyer Intent within the foreseeable future as we see this as being a great way to provide out outbound sales teams with warmer prospects to contact. 
What they disliked about the product: I can't see any negatives so far so we are looking forward to using the G2 platform more in the future. 

Review title: G2 Helps Promote Business
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 assists in sharing information about our product.  It's great that valid users are the ones reviewing the product so that others can benefit from what it has to offer.

Working with the staff at G2 has been nothing less than stellar.  Everyone is readily available to answer questions and they always help you get the most out of their services.  If they see you aren't utilizing a feature you are paying for, they take time to show you how it works and why it's good for your business.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing.  The website UI has been an upgrade and makes it even easier to get what you need.

What they liked about the product: The team was very responsive, fabulous with follow-up, quick to hop on the phone.Appreciate all the hand holding to get things to the finish line. Definitely a fabulous personable team with great tech.
What they disliked about the product: We had some bumps in terms of how to classify our company (set up each product individually or as a company) which delayed things, but once that was set, it was very smooth and simple. 

Review title: Deepest Funnel Intent on the Market
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love seeing who's looking at our reviews, it gives our sales team a huge advantage but it also helps our CS team retain our current clients.

Review title: Proactive Onboarding and Support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: That the team has a great schedule of walkthroughs and training with what's available in the G2 system. They don't give you a packet and have you figure it out yourself, they schedule one on ones to make sure you know what is available to you. They also provide best practices on what other users are doing to make sure you're ahead of the game.
What they disliked about the product: No dislikes here - all the content sent over is easy to understand. 

Review title: Bringing transparency and ease to our buyers

What they liked about the product: In the past, we have had a difficult time gathering feedback from our customers regarding their experience with our products but G2 has helped make this process easy. They do all the work for us and our customers are eager to share their feedback and see what other customers are saying. 
What they disliked about the product: It does cost a significant amount for each individual profile. If the profiles were less expensive, we would be able to add all of our products to the site.

Review title: Robus platform, super efficient onboarding.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: A lot of functionality and features that can help automate processes for you. This platform makes it easy to connect - and communicate - with potential customers. It's also really helpful to see their rather detailed feedback and insights when leaving a review.
What they disliked about the product: There is a LOT to do and learn but, in time, the platform starts to become more familiar. There's always so much potential using it - it's about focusing on what you can do now and organizing your next steps accordingly. (The efficiently organized onboarding process and follow-up emails are a huge assist in this!)

Review title: Implementation Review
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Attention detail to our business and guidance on how we can be successful in utilizing G2's functionality. The team assigned to us was fantastic - personable and professional. G2 is a very sophisticated review platform with a lot of automation and features to learn which could potentially be overwhelming in the beginning -- but their team was very responsive and thorough in their explanations  - alleviating concerns quickly and helping us to get fully onboarded in less than a month.
What they disliked about the product: That we didn't get on G2 last year! Do not have anything negative to say.

Review title: Great Platform. Great Service

Review title: G2 is an authentic software review site
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Like many industries, ours has a lot of noise. Many competitors have beautiful websites with illustrious graphics, but their actual product experience is bloated, unusable crap. G2 helps surface that reality and differentiate competitors with real feedback from real users.
What they disliked about the product: I think the navigation of G2's admin platform could use some re-thinking. I'd be happy to whiteboard with the product team.

Review title: G2 helped us improve our visibility in our software category. Their support is the best!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 team helped us market our product on their website to drive traffic to our website and makes comparing products a breeze.
What they disliked about the product: We were a bit skeptical on the upfront cost of marketing on G2, but the support that they offer makes up more than plenty for the investment and we believe that we will get a good return on our investment.

Review title: Great experience so far!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love G2's model overall. It's based on your company's actual product as opposed to a bidding system (which can be misleading to customers). The software is also really easy to use, so it was a smooth onboarding process and it's been really easy to add new team members with minimal training. The sales and onboarding team were also super helpful in working with us through the process. When we were onboarding, Ali provided detailed follow-ups for us with action items and next steps. I had to contact support once and it was really easy and the rep, Leah, really went above and beyond contacting technical support to resolve my issue.
What they disliked about the product: The price is a little steep for where we are as a company, but we've already seen a lot of value from it, so I think it will pay for itself.

Review title: Shows a great deal of promise as a new marketing channel for B2B SaaS

What they disliked about the product: It's hard to accurately determine the ROI of investing in the platform up front through the team does have a lot of comparable test data to share.

Review title: Extremely helpful team and a seamless onboarding experience
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I enjoyed having regular contact with our account manager throughout the on-boarding process. This enabled us to really understand the platform end-to-end. I also really appreciate the support the team have given us. They are always on hand to answer a question or help provide tips or insight into how to get the most out of their platformn.
What they disliked about the product: My only gripe is that I think there could be more clarity around ranking algorithm  which determines where businesses get to on the category pages. There could be more clarity around exactly why some of the reviews have been rejected or are ineligible. Often I have to reach out to the AM to understand why this is the case.

Review title: I'm seeing value from day #1
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The administrative portal is easy to understand and navigate.
What they disliked about the product: There is a lot to cover in 3 half hour on boarding sessions, I think two of my went longer and I could have benefited from one more.

Review title: Great platform
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is commited to provide honest reviews to the customers, and unlike most review websites they don't ask software providers to pay to be listed higher. Their onboarding is super useful and we're thinking to build something like this for MeisterTask as well.
What they disliked about the product: The UX of the review form could be improved..

Review title: Very thorough onboarding process
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Our G2 team took the time to understand our company and answer our questions in order to give us the best value.
What they disliked about the product: The onboarding process was maybe a bit long, with many contact points, although very well structured and organized.

What they liked about the product: G2 team's enthusiasm and support were amazing, it helped us to be on top 10! The Amazon Voucher campaign was a great idea!
What they disliked about the product: Only thing i don't like: To be not able to use the option of the GIF on the cover picture.

Review title: Indispensable Solution for Brand Awareness, Brand Credibility and Buyer Intent
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 provides our brand with user-driven credibility. In a world where our buyers make their decisions and evaluate solutions on their own, G2 has provided us with an "always-on" voice of the customer channel. If I were to narrow it down to one this it would be the return. G2 has a significant ROI and is well worth the investment.
What they disliked about the product: Not much I can say. We love the CSM and sales teams. The platform is easy to use and massively intuitive.

Review title: Being a G2 Partner
Rating: 2.5
What they liked about the product: The team I worked with was helpful. The incentive program is useful in gaining more reviews.
What they disliked about the product: I think the reverse IP look up leave a lot of potential customers out of the buyer intent. High cost for a non-lead generating program. I don't like that I can't select which categories are brand falls under. I don't like that we paid $$$ and still can't have a graph in our category. I don't like that G2 doesn't qualify the buyer intent data to be useful for your organization.

Review title: Excellent Site with Strong Processes and Tools
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The Market Data really helps to understand the competitive landscape, and gauge where we need to improve. The Buyer Intent data is an excellent tool for us to determine real opportunities and who is searching for our solutions. Finally, the Review Process is very strong and leaves zero doubt regarding authenticity.
What they disliked about the product: The Market Data can be confusing with the high number of categories and crossover with tangental products/solutions. Buyer Intent data does not provide quite the level of detail desired to make quick effective use. The Review Process is daunting for new reviewers and takes a lot of time and detail to complete - causing some people to just drop out of the process.

Review title: Great implementation team and quick results
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team (Dylan Tate and Lena Lee) has been really helpful during the first steps of working with G2.
What they disliked about the product: The process for users to leave a review is long.

Review title: The best platform to give your customers a voice
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: - Great onboarding experience: the team was very friendly, responsive and helpful during the whole process
- Buyer intent data: this is a truly innovative way of helping us to connect to potential buyers, which no other platform offers
- The objective rankings in the grids, and real customer feedback are the best marketing material for us
- Integration with LinkedIn matched audiences is a big plus

Although we just started with G2 a month ago, I am very curious to see the ROI in a couple of months!
What they disliked about the product: Nothing major so far. It would be cool to have some extra integrations with other tools (e.g. we use Pipedrive as a CRM), but this is not really a deal breaker for us.

Review title: Very Friendly and Helpful People
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The personal touch is evident in all communications with G2 staff and they are unfailingly pleasant and helpful.
What they disliked about the product: As a vendor, I don't think the administration site is as easy to use as it could be.  Or maybe it could just be organized better. It seems like every time I turn around there is something else that I haven't heard of before. Maybe it's just me, but I would like to see an outline of all the steps involved in creating your initial profile and then what can be added later.

Review title: easy to use platform for vendors.  marketing content you can leverage for leads
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Ease of use of the platform, both on an admin side and for our users. the easier a platform is the more likely users will actually review you, sothat saves a lot of time. 
Great G2 team to work with (Tommy and Lena) who've been very supportive and helpful.
What they disliked about the product: Not much to dislike worth mentioning here. I made a couple of product recommendation based on my usage of the platform which were taken into account. that's great!

Review title: No smoke and mirrors
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: You can't pay to get to the top. I love that it's not a "pay-to-play" review platform like so many others. The reviews are from real people that genuinely care about products. The platform is easy to use, too!
What they disliked about the product: Nothing, at the moment! The user-friendly platform is great, the onboarding process was great, and the results from our hard work are great as well.

Review title: Great way to generate outbound and get marketing materials.
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The onboarding team was great. We wanted to move fast and they were able to match our speed. They came up with training for our specific teams that were key to getting everyone up and running quickly. The key to being successful is to follow the plan initially.
What they disliked about the product: There were some issues with like-named products that we had to sort out with the G2 team. We also ran into issues with our automation. The G2 team was great and helped us by giving us a few extras. I also wish G2 did more external marketing on LinkedIn and other professional sites so that the value of their product was more well known.

Review title: Smooth onboarding

What they liked about the product: There's a human I can contact with questions.
What they disliked about the product: We're still very new to the platform but don't have any dislikes at this time.

Review title: Excellent onboarding experience
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The onboarding experience was brilliant, our specialist was very knowledgable and helpful throughout the processes and got us up and running collecting reviews in a few days and sharing best practice for our page.
What they disliked about the product: Intent data is a fixed cost at one of the higher product tiers which when the volume is fairly low especially product page level intent it's very hard to justify the investment in the middle tier.

Review title: Great onboarding and results from day 1
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The best thing about G2 is how the plan and onboarding are tailored to our business case. This has meant that the implementation and customer success team from G2 has been able to help us towards reaching our goals instead of "just" showing us the platform.
Also, we've gotten specific examples and cases of how to best use the G2 features for us, and together we've already set goals for what we want to achieve together.
We've been using G2 for a few years now, and we've seen great results in review generation and, more importantly, lead generation and sales. 
The Buyer Intent data available to us has really helped us out in many different ways, and we now use the data in marketing, sales, and customer success.
What they disliked about the product: I've found a few places where the documentation of features doesn't seem to be updated completely. An example could be for the different widgets, where it's not very clear how they are actually going to look. A few images/examples (maybe just with dummy data) would be great to show precisely what a widget does and how it'll look when implemented.

Review title: Guided onboarding and expert advice lead to stellar results!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The onboarding experience was top notch and immensely helpful in understanding how to best optimize our company profile, gain valuable reviews, and explore and understand buyer intent and behavior. We have seen amazing results and have empowered our customers to share their successes with the broader community.
What they disliked about the product: Integrating into Salesforce took a good deal longer than anticipated, but their development team was always willing to step in and help our side out while dealing with permission issues.

What they disliked about the product: I have liked everything thus far, I have no complaints.

Review title: So much more than a review platform
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: When we first partnered with G2, our primary goal was review generation. They made it easy to run review campaigns and took the burden off of our marketing and customer teams to do outreach to clients. With a great library of reviews, we're now able to leverage  testimonials across our marketing and sales campaigns to lend 3rd party credibility to our service offerings.
What they disliked about the product: G2 has so many capabilities, it was a bit overwhelming to tackle everything at once. Luckily our customer relationship manager helped us focus and prioritize, and we're now fully leveraging all the platform has to offer!

Review title: The goto platform for user reviews
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is an amazing product review site with the most genuine community of users and their reviews for products across categories.
What they disliked about the product: Being on the other side of handling the company page for Oorwin, I have found the review moderation policies to be extremely stringent. While the thoughts and efforts are to maintain authentic and genuine reviews, there should be a revalidation for review rejection rates - for eg when it is beyond 50%, there should be a re-check as to why this is happening.

Review title: Easy to Launch
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Team was fantastic easy to work with and the on boarding was easy to launch..  Our clients have found it easy to make the reviews and they also appreciate the gift cards that come with our initial contract...
What they disliked about the product: Would love to see more leads or opportunities come from our listings.

Review title: G2 is a amazing platform to help get the pulse on your customers feedback
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: My favorite part is how easy G2 is to use for our customers and for me as the admin! Most online review platforms make leaving a review difficult or time consuming which mean I have to do a lot of babysitting when we do a review campaign but not G2. I also love how easy it is to leverage the reports for building our sales pipeline!

The other part that really stands out was the support I receive from my customer success manager. It is a huge time saver to know that I have someone willing to help me out when I need it and share best practices.
What they disliked about the product: Would love if we could use our CC to purchase Gift Cards. This is on the roadmap I heard.

Review title: One of the best business software review sites around
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2's model: their combination of market presence and user satisfaction, and visualizing vendors in specific categories on a grid with these dimensions, is beneficial to B2B SaaS buyers and, by extension, B2B SaaS marketers. Their buyer intent data helps Marketing and Sales teams determine the buying behaviour on G2's site. Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.
What they disliked about the product: Their reporting needs improvement. G2 had a helpful ROI tool. It synced with Salesforce and would map buyer intent to your opportunities to know whether G2 buyer intent happened on an opp before or during an opp (lead gen vs influence). Unfortunately, they pulled this tool to re-tool it. For now, it's hard to truly measure the impact of G2 buyer intent (without the right resources on your end to configure Salesforce and the G2 SFDC connector to make pull off the same or similar ROI reporting). Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

Review title: Great SaaS Product Review Platform
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a great resource for information around SaaS Products as well as other software. They have a lot of great insights and I find the reviews reliable as well.
What they disliked about the product: I wish it was a bit easier to give reviews, but also understand that they need to make sure they are legitimate, so I understand that.

Review title: Great onboarding experience with a great team that was helpful.
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Thorough, professional and helpful during the entire process.
What they disliked about the product: Wish there was a "Try before you buy" option that I could take advantage of.

Review title: The Destination for Product Reviews in B2B Tech/Cybersecurity
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 platform is night and day compared to our rough experience with Gartner Peer Insights (i.e. unexplained review rejections, lack of transparency, slow response, etc.). Even as a freemium customer (no paid subscription, our experience with the G2 team has been fantastic. They got our profile up and running within days and helped us bring in new reviews with a dedicated landing page to get us started. Now we have a go-to source for market validation.
What they disliked about the product: Not much to dislike. Their market categories could be more well-defined. Sometimes you're comparing apples to oranges in G2 grids when it comes to cybersecurity products, but it's at least a step ahead of Gartner Peer Insights (we're in the "Security - Other" category).

Review title: The place to be and be found in a multitude of categories
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Very good backend full of insight to better manage your online presence, and marketing tools to leverage your user reviews.
What they disliked about the product: The transparency of the criteria used to rank companies in the ranks and grids could be more clear. It's not obvious what's the weight of each attribute to increase or decrease a company position.

Review title: G2 Marketing Solutions is key part of the buyer's journey
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like the fact that G2 is a key part of buyer's decision making process to proceed forward with a company or not after reviewing the products reviews found on G2.
What they disliked about the product: We found it hard to integrate the intent data into something meaningful in our Marketo instance.

Review title: Great onboarding and continuous support!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The best thing about G2 is how the implementation and customer success team from G2 take the time to onboard you onto the platform, set goals, and provide the tools to meet the goals. 

In a couple of months, we were able to double review volume with one campaign and generate new sales and marketing collateral to leverage across the organization.
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing to call out at this point.

Review title: G2 is a fantastic partner to work with!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Our partnership is always helpful and strategic. I feel like they really listen to our goals and concerns and respond with insightful and useful suggestions on how to further our reviews and our profile.
What they disliked about the product: There isn't a lot I dislike about G2. I do wish there was more tracking available when using the resource pages.

Review title: G2 Marketing Solutions are Essential Business Tools
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: There are several helpful aspects of working with G2 Marketing Solutions, some of which include everything from an easy to use platform to innovative marketing ideas. However, a few of the most important aspects to mention are the traffic driven to our business pages, the qualified leads and opportunities, and the collaborative spirit of G2's Customer Success Teams. When a service provider acts like an extension of ones business, only good can result.
What they disliked about the product: We have not had any issues working with G2 Marketing Solutions. To date the collaboration has been seamless and collaborative.

Review title: Customer support like no other
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The dedication that my account manager had to my account to ensure we truly were getting the most out of the account.  When we had to build business justifications for our C-suite, they were with us at every step.  Look, I know part of their job is to look for new business opportunities, but I can attest that they only did so to ensure that we continued to get value out of the account.  And we did.
What they disliked about the product: I wish there was more insight into the G2's product roadmap and transparency in how customer feedback helps drive that innovation.  G2 needs to do a better job in focusing and showcasing their customers and how we shape where G2's product is headed next.

Review title: Light up your Voice of the Customer
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Super easy for customers to leave reviews. Quick and easy + incentive. Good for helping get a high volume of reviews in quickly to help better compete in your industry. Also appreciate their actual tool - good analytics platform and easy to manage profile compared to other Review Sites. Customer success has also been great.
What they disliked about the product: The need to pay for multiple profiles to "own" them. Especially when you have a platform where you'd prefer it all to roll up nicely together. Seems disjointed and just a way for them to get more money.

Review title: G2 has been a great enterprise partner
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our Account Manager and CSM are super involved in growing our profiles. They're super smart and strategic. They're also always available for when we need support running reviews campaigns.
What they disliked about the product: No dislikes here. They have been great partners!

Review title: Great Review Platform!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is singlehandedly the best source for reviews to help you choose the right software for your business. I love how the platform is very user-friendly which makes it super easy to navigate. There is a lot of value in customer feedback, and this is definitely the most reliable platform to find that information.
What they disliked about the product: G2 is great and I've found nothing I dislike about the platform.

Review title: Impactful relationship, driven by world-class Account Management.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our account management team, particularly Jeremy and Mike, is second to none. They invest the time to understand the nuances and complexities of our business.  They help drive and inform our strategy and tactical goals for advocacy and review ecosystem management, so that we have tangible benchmarks keeping everyone focused and accountable to our overall goals.  They continually look for ways to add value to our relationship, and test into new opportunities.  11/10 would recommend.
What they disliked about the product: It would be nice to have additional pricing options at varying levels for the content licensing packages.

Review title: Great Partnership
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Working with G2 was a simple and easy experience that allowed us to drive a number of positive reviews on their platform. The partnership they create and the guidance they provide was extremely helpful.
What they disliked about the product: We didn't have visibility into the reviews as they we're coming in- would've been interesting to see in real time what sort of feedback was being left.

Review title: Great technology and team
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The team we have worked with is committed to our organization's success.  This has created a winning strategy for our organization!
What they disliked about the product: our organization's inability to set up the SFDC connector.  If you have "bad data" it can be tough to launch

Review title: You Wont Find Better!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We have probably the best CSM out there - shout out to Jeremy Levin! This makes our experience 10x better and what makes me recommend G2 to others professionals over and over again. Not only is his support to help us really maximize profile traffic and brand reputation across G2 categories through our bi-weekly check-ins, research audits, and marketplace assessments super helpful, but his willingness to constantly go above what we ask and offer us more is amazing.  Our team at G2, the resources they provide us  with and the knowledge they share is the best I have had. Like I said, you won't find better!
What they disliked about the product: Not much to dislike. Our G2 team has been awesome in helping us if we have any issues.

Review title: Top-tier competitive intel support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 has allowed our sellers to leverage multiple angles when selling against competitors (i.e. review quantity, review quality, feature comparisons, etc.). And on top of that, the assets that they provide our team with are designed according to our brand guidelines... lightening the load for our creative team.

I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention our fantastic account team. Jeremy Levin has been an incredible resource for us as we've grown into new categories and analyzed competitors. In addition to simply answering questions, he comes to the table with suggestions as new products, features, or grids roll out to help us get the most bang for our buck.
What they disliked about the product: I would love to understand more, from a competitive perspective, how other vendors are able to rank on specific grids. There are cases where some vendors are on a specific grid that I don't believe belong, and it's difficult to understand how they got there and create a "dismiss" talk track for our sellers.

For example, why is competitor "X" listed under grid "A?" There are specific rules that vendors must follow in order to rank on a grid, but in my opinion, it's not specific enough to truly understand what our sellers are up against.

Review title: Wonderful experience
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our CSM, Jeremy, is so dedicated and excited - it's rejuvenating!
What they disliked about the product: I can't say I have much to include here as I don't actively use the platform but more consult and distribute.

Review title: A true partnership with unwavering support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is clearly a leader in this space and they make it easy and attainable for partners to utilize and leverage their reports. The way that they break down each vendors strengths, weaknesses, and comparisons to competitors is so valuable! 

Having an extremely attentive and proactive account manager is very beneficial and goes a long way and makes it easy to get the most out of the partnership.
What they disliked about the product: The only downside is not being able to use all of the reports if they're not licensed!

Review title: Love working with the G2 team!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The partnership in working with the G2 team! They have been able to answer all of our questions on the capabilities of G2, what solutions would work best for our team, and maximizing our results from using this product.
What they disliked about the product: G2 offers many solutions when it comes to Marketing Solutions. It can be difficult determining the best solution for your business at first, but our Account Manager and CSM have been super helpful in this process for us!

Review title: An Effective Tool for Showcasing our Customers' Experiences
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to leverage product reviews as well as the index, grid, and head-to-head competitor reports has proven to be a valuable asset. We have been able to show strong ROI and we aren't necessarily utilizing the tools as effectively as we could. 

Also, our G2 team is amazing. They're responsive, helpful, creative, and always looking to take something of our plate to get something done.
What they disliked about the product: The Activated Profile package is pricey and not well aligned to businesses who don't engage in account-based marketing. It would be nice to have a package with much of those features adjusted for those of us who can't make as much use of the business intent data and lean more on content-based lead and demand generation.

Review title: Love G2!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We have had excellent luck with G2. Our sales team uses G2 to close more and more deals, and in marketing, we use G2 to solidify our great position in the market. We love that all of the content is available for us to use in competitive campaigns and that's it all coming from a 3rd party source. People love to do their own research nowadays and we want to be sure they are seeing our product in the best light!
What they disliked about the product: There really is no downside to G2! If you have any issues, you have great customer success reps who make things super easy to understand and put into practice.

Review title: Only as good as you make it ...
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We've been on the Power Plan for nearly 8 months, slow to adopt all of the paid features available to us. Those we've leveraged: Upgraded Profile, Testimonial Widget, Customer Reference Page, and Real-Time Leads. We're soon to embrace the Marketo lead webhooks and buyer intent integration. What do I like best? Admin Portal ease-of-use. Platform is super intuitive. Intent data, marketing content and other analytics are easily accessible via MyG2 menu, no need to hunt. Customer reference pages are easy to build, too. Support from Customer Success is great.
What they disliked about the product: We've not yet leveraged all of the paid features available to us, can only speak to those we have: nothing to dislike at this point, really. I do, at times, feel pressured, sometimes rushed, to utilize plan to fullest potential (understandably, as CS team is eager to prove value), and felt the onboarding process was hurried, though we're not quite there yet. Baby steps is how we roll.

Review title: Strategic partner for driving brand reputation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our G2 team has been a strategic partner for us in managing our brand reputation across key G2 categories, maximizing our profile and driving traffic to our website. Our CSM Jeremy Levin is a rockstar, and has been proactive in providing recommendations for how to drive more reviews to our profile. He is very service-oriented and always quick to respond whenever I have a question. We also have a Slack channel with our G2 account team set up so communication is always quick and transparent.
What they disliked about the product: We had shared feedback about improvements we'd like to see for the process of leaving G2 reviews to make it more seamless. This feedback was well received by the G2 team.

Review title: Great Partnership & Resource for third-party validation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a great place to garner customer feedback and provide third-party reviews for your sales team to leverage. Our customer success team (Alexis and Mike) is terrific - always helpful, responsive and provide the trusted partnership to drive alignment. Whenever I have odd requests or needs, they are always available to help. There are a number of constraints on what we can do but our CSM team is always helpful with new ideas/solutions.
What they disliked about the product: I don't have much that I dislike. I do wish the Grid Reports were a little more selective in terms of categories and segments. We do place well in those but sometimes the volume of reports and badges make it difficult to hone in on a message. We like to leverage these with our sales team but it can be hard to find a few key takeaways for it. That's the one area that we'd like to improve.

Review title: A fantastic platform that serves many use cases!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 offers a wealth of insights and content. Whether it's leveraging customer testimonials and leader badges for social proof that you can use across many marketing channels, the information you can glean from the grid reports, custom comparison reports, or the G2 buyer intent data - there is something for everyone - for all functions of your organization (not just Marketing!). Also, our account team is top-notch, Jeremy and Mike are easily the best respective CSM and AE I've work ever worked with across other vendors/partners - they are responsive, passionate, creative, and work with us like they are a part of OUR team.
What they disliked about the product: Content licenses are required for every category your solution falls within, which can be cost-prohibitive if you have a solution that falls within many categories

Review title: Transforming our marketing strategy with G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our account team! Michael, Alexis, and Jeremy really made the difference in our utilization. They made suggestions we wouldn't have thought of. They have been there every step of the way.
What they disliked about the product: There is just so much, and not enough time to implement. We're a smaller demand gen team, which makes expanding our efforts a bit difficult. We've leaned on our account team to help, but there is just so much, it can be overwhelming at times. I also don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, a lot of room to grow.

Review title: Wonderful Enterprise Support!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: While the platform is super intuitive to use, it's our account management that makes G2 a 10.
What they disliked about the product: It can sometimes be difficult for multi-function teams to manage when there are distinct goals for each but we're getting there.

Review title: Great team makes it easy to work with and strengthen our brand
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The inbound leads that come in are high quality. These are prospects who have us on their short list and are actively researching our solutions further. On the review generation side, the dashboard is very helpful and intuitive. Reports are easy to find and it makes it very easy to manage our product profiles. The G2 team is very supportive and responsive, you feel like you've got additional team members with them.
What they disliked about the product: The quantity of leads can be low at times

What they liked about the product: G2 review service is the best! This platform allows prospects and vendors to learn about your software and service through real user experiences. The CSMs are involved at every step of implementation and execution. they're typically very proactive in providing assistance and ideas for review campaigns.
What they disliked about the product: The quarterly report methodology and algorithms need additional details and explanations.

Review title: G2 is an essential partner for our content and demand generation efforts
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd gives us the content we need to fuel our demand generation and social proof efforts. Customers and prospects are hungry for real information, not the same features and benefits every vendor claims. 
With the content subscription we are able to offer prospective  buyers  helpful insights based on reviews from peers to help inform their purchase.  The Customer Success team is also great to work with and always 
offer great advice and use cases from other company experiences that accelerate our goals.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing, really.  I had experience with G2 from a previous company and it's even better the second time.

Review title: The best Peer Review platform outthere
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I'm working with 7 peer platforms, but G2 is by far the most comprehensive one, from the UX to the features offered in order to serve our company goals.  They provide a lot of great features for business growth.
What they disliked about the product: I don't have anything to add here. Everything runs smooth.

Review title: Helpful partners on the journey
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The G2 team understands what is important to us, and they help us get the most out of their platform.  They make it convenient for us to capture reviews and see the things we need to improve upon from our clients' comments.  The team provides great support and provides ideas that help us keep our program fresh and evolving.
What they disliked about the product: There is always some portion of our audience that views the information here with skepticism, but G2 provides ample information to overcome those objections.

Review title: Responsive & attentive account team, useful sales tool
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Great customer service. Our account team is A+. Jamie + Steph are super responsive and ready to help when we need them. They give good advice on where to prioritize our efforts. 

On the product side, we get good insights into customer sentiment and competitive intelligence. The quarterly Grid reports are a forcing function to ensure we are continuously generating new reviews and customer feedback. 

Grid reports help arm sales with third-party validation of our product. There is likely more we can be doing here.
What they disliked about the product: As one of the leading SaaS review sites, I view G2 as a "necessary evil'. We need to have a presence on G2, and a good one at that.

We have not seen success with automated review generation, and thus have to invest a lot of time and money in order to see the return. The number of reviews is important, which means that bigger companies with more customers are at an inherent advantage over startups or growing companies. 

I wish we could set up unique review links ourselves instead of having to rely on our account team. They are always on top of it, but seems like something we could/should be able to do easily ourselves.

Review title: Open line of communication and always willing to help
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The team at G2 is always willing to answer our questions and connect with multiple business units and stakeholders to explain and help us utilize all of the benefits G2 has to offer. Our account reps are friendly and very organized, I can trust they are guiding us in the right direction to optimize our G2 profile.
What they disliked about the product: No downsides come to mind, the experience I have had with the G2 Marketing Solutions team has always been informative and helpful.

Review title: Lots of capabilities tough implementation
Rating: 2.0
What they liked about the product: Intent data and competitive insights are helpful features
What they disliked about the product: The Terminus integration and complexity of the Salesforce integration

Review title: Sr Marketing Portfolio Manager
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Review generation options and intent alerts base on the categories of choice are remarkable options. From one side, the ability to run review campaigns across LinkedIn and targeted outreach from the G2 team is flawless, plus having a dedicated reviews link for specific tactics makes it even easier to drive reviews across different tactics. 

Intent alerts serve multiple use cases (anything from outreach prioritization, personalized messaging, or determine at-risk accounts who may be shopping for competitors) , and G2 makes it easy to integrate it with your CRM or even directly to Outreach.

Finally, the support from Jeremy and Mike (CSM and AE) is amazing. They are available to bring new ideas to the table and even give you friendly nudges to keep you on track with projects.
What they disliked about the product: Aligning on profile categories maybe sometimes challenging, especially when managing a complex portfolio of embedded solutions.

Review title: Unbiased Insights From Your Customers
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I am the primary user of G2. I like G2 because it's quick and easy for my customer to share their thoughts and feelings about their experience using my company's products. Partnering with my Enterprise Customer Success Manager, Carly Cozad, and Strategic Account Executive, Nick Espey, we've landed on the right strategy, which has allowed us to drive hundreds of new reviews. These reviews have lead to the creation of dozens of new pieces of marketing collateral. Even the occasional negative review has allowed our Customer Success and Support teams to get involved in monitoring reviews. I really like how we've been able to use our G2 profile as a lead generation source. Once the lead form is completed, I receive a notification and the lead is added to my instance of Salesforce so that I can track it.
What they disliked about the product: My company is used across a number of different industries and is applicable across a lot of different user types. As a result, my company's product is listed in a lot of grid reports. It can be a bit challenging to drive reviews for all of the different use cases and industries. I would like to see more internal adoption of the intent data and comparison pages. I think G2 does a great job of putting a lot of data into your hands, but I'd like to see G2 make it simple to leverage that data to help their customers make smart decisions in terms of which prospects to focus on and which ones to put into a nurture track.

Review title: Amazing tool for generating reviews
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Very easy to generate quality reviews for our product lines
What they disliked about the product: Could be easier to automate reviews especially using Salesforce.

Review title: A strong review platform with great enterprise support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is able to help our marketing and sales teams with customer content! The incentivized reviews have allowed us to listen to our customer stories and equip our sales teams with testimonials that they can use throughout the sales cycle.
What they disliked about the product: We had a hard time making use of the intent data with G2 and utilizing it within our marketing programs. Without user level data, it is hard to know intent of a company and difficult to put that data into scalable programs.

Review title: One of the leading software review sites
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: What I like best about G2 is their admin portal. It is very user friendly and has many great resources. I love the dashboard, G2 reference pages, and Competitors dashboard. G2 makes it easy for me to prepare great assets for our sales and marketing teams. The G2 customer support is also really great. I can always count on my time to answer any questions and assist me with any requests I may have.
What they disliked about the product: I dislike the frequency and large amounts of reports they offer. I think it dilutes their validity for prospects and sales.  I also dislike how short their reviews are. I don't think a reviewer is encouraged enough to leave longer more helpful reviews that give better insight into the product.

Review title: Nearly all my advocacy needs met
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We have a great support team that helps us unlock the full potential of leveraging every tool/feature that G2 has to offer. With G2, we're able to create marketing assets that helps substantiate our place in the market against our competition backed by realtime customer feedback.  The competitor comparison reports, additional content opportunities and video reviews have all made my job so much easier and fun. The dashboard is very user friendly and easy to use and navigate around to find what I'm looking for. I'm currently in my second role/company leveraging G2, and I couldn't imagine being a marketing professional without it.
What they disliked about the product: I cannot think of anything at the moment.

Review title: Insight and Alerts I need to stay competitive and book more meetings!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Understanding and knowing when a company is exploring my companies reviews and/or my competitor's reviews. Having this in real-time or close to real-time can really increase my response rate. For example, I see they are looking at comparing vendors to one of my competitors. That tells me they are already in talks with that competitor and looking to see who else they should consider - enter me!

There are major upsides to using G2 not just for competitive comparisons but also to reflect on what your customer like and/or dislike. This can be great feedback for customer success teams and product teams! It also helps me understand what I need to do a better job of explaining specific features/use cases. 

I also love that I can get insights/alert via slack! I'm sure they have several integrations that would work for any b2b company.
What they disliked about the product: Too many email notifications - I wish they wouldn't send repetitive alerts within the same week for the same company. It's overkill, but at the same time It makes sure I don't miss anything! I know they can't share personal information but that would obviously be great! Given you don't have insights into the person who was researching on g2, you have to get a little creative and leverage a larger net for your initial outreach. 

I don't like that the last review (video) is automatically the first thing a customer sees, if this isn't a good review but there are 8 others that are, why does it have to be highlighted? I feel like our company should get to choose which video is shown on our main page on G2. 

Information isn't always accurate that is left by our customers, I can specifically see where they have made false claims. Most are not from verified customers which makes me think, could this bad review be a competitor trying to tarnish my brand?

Review title: Fantastic insights into our customers, product, and more
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love the versatility. G2 goes so far beyond just gathering reviews and provides us with a ton of valuable insights into our customers. We've been able to surface feedback up to our product team, proactively address any potential questions/concerns a customer has, and help identify some great customer advocates. We love being able to hear what's on our customers' minds so we are able to continue providing them with an excellent product and service.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing jumps to mind at the moment. Any questions or concerns I've had have been addressed by G2's very friendly, prompt, and helpful CS team!

Review title: User Friendly Platform with Great Customer Service
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Real time leads on people who are actively searching for your service and looking at your product. It's great to know there will already be some familiarity with us when our Sales Team reaches out.
What they disliked about the product: Since G2 can't send actual contact info, it can sometime be hard tracking down the specific person who was searching (especially now that people are working from home and in different locations).

Review title: G2 has helped our product improve visibility
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 team is dedicated to our success. They are always looking for ways for us to get more out of the service.
What they disliked about the product: Truthfully, there is nothing I can add here.

Review title: A Lot of Great Content
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Comparison Reports are such a great asset if you have the right reviews for certain categories. You can effectively tell the story about why your product is better in an easy-to-read chart. This is great for your sales team.
What they disliked about the product: There is so much content and opportunity at your fingertips that it can be overwhelming. Managing G2 could practically be a full-time job, and I worry that I'm not using G2 to its fullest potential.

Review title: G2 Has Been Great - Good for Marketers
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I haven't gotten a chance yet to explore all of G2's features, (there's a lot), but since I've started working with G2 about one year ago, it has been nothing but rewarding. When I've provided feedback, G2 has listened to it and accomodated it. They're trusted in our Industry and therefore, we've been able to benefit from G2's services as a marketing team. They seem to gather great, honest reviews and I'm happy so far.
What they disliked about the product: There's not really a ton that I dislike. Again, I can't speak to too many of G2's products as I've only dabbled in a couple.

Review title: G2 has been tremendous for our company!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team we work with is always making sure our company succeeds. We focus on our needs, create targets/goals, then execute together. We have been able to drive over 80 reviews in the past year and increase our overall rating due to the dedication, and hard work G2 has put into our company. Looking forward to continuing to achieve our goals!
What they disliked about the product: There's nothing to dislike about G2! The only thing I'd say is it is a team effort, so you need to have a solid internal team along with G2 to create any movement for your company.

Review title: The premier B2B software research site
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: For the prospect, G2 provides so many different datapoints for research. You are able to look at everything from rankings to ratings to feature ratings to market presence. For the vendor, there are sales enablement tools, lead generation options and we are able to drive traffic to our sites.
What they disliked about the product: Not enough questions on the review form leads to a lot of low-quality review content.

Review title: Helpful Support Team with Good Insight into Market
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Outstanding vendor support. From proactively coming to us with suggestions to stepping in to help with updates when the team is short on time, they are one of the most responsive and helpful vendor teams I work with.

Content Assets: Grid and competitive reports provide user-generated validation against competitors.
What they disliked about the product: Content licenses are required for every category and product, meaning that if you have a few different product types, you have to pay for each one individually. There are no group packages for companies that fit in multiple categories making it very expensive.

Review title: Excellent Service and Insights
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love the ad targeting that I can achieve based on G2 data, and the team is great at providing insight into the best way to leverage the available assets and insights.
What they disliked about the product: I am not always sure that I am taking full advantage of the service.  I would like to know how more customers have leveraged everything.

Review title: Big promises, poor delivery
Rating: 2.0
What they liked about the product: We received excellent service during set-up and onboarding, making it easy to leverage the G2 profile and marketing outreach almost immediately.
What they disliked about the product: Their algorithm is very misleading. The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks. We've found the experience with G2 to be very disappointing and borderline dishonest. I'm not hopeful that we'll hear back from them. We've discontinued all promotions of our profile on G2.

Review title: A Platform Which Address Modern Digital Marketing Needs
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Impressive competitive intel capabilities
What they disliked about the product: I do not dislike anything about G2, they fullfill the current needs that we have.

Review title: G2: A Trusted Partner in Showcasing Your Value
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 provides a great platform to communicate the benefits of your offering. Not only that, but G2's flexibility in their content offerings means you can build strategic assets that address every persona.
What they disliked about the product: I've had some minor challenges on the backend/admin side but nothing that wasn't resolved quickly by the G2 support staff.

Review title: Good luck getting G2 to actually respond and do anything
Rating: 1.5
What they liked about the product: It looks like a great review site and we would like to spend money with them.
What they disliked about the product: It's super difficult to get in touch with them to actually spend money with. Then when you finally do get in touch with them, they are so slow at updating the product profiles that you may as well do it yourself. We worked with them to update our profile and they told us that if we sent updates on all the listings in a single batch, they would do on the backend. That was on May 17th. Now it's June 10th and they have done precisely nothing. By comparison, TrustRadius updated within two weeks. IT Central haven't stopped emailing us weekly to work out how they can help further. Capterra gave us access within days. G2 is asleep at the wheel, their sales team barely responsive. The sales experience is frankly appalling and substandard.

Review title: G2 is a tool every customer marketer should have in their arsenal
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 dashboards make it very easy for me to track the performance of all our products on G2, as well as manage review campaigns. I have all the data I need to design our review strategy for the upcoming months or to share our progress with the company at the tips of my fingers. The best part is, of course, quarterly G2 award badges. Being able to win awards by market segment, region, and theme (like "Best Results" or "Easy to Use") helps us highlight our value propositions for different audiences.
What they disliked about the product: In the future, I'd like to see a more seamless integration of G2's data with our CRM. That being said, G2 is a very innovative company - and their product gets better all the time.

Review title: Buyer Signals that Ignite the Sales Process
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The buyer intent signals allow us to share timely buyer insights with our sales teams that are helping to drive valuable conversations and revenue pipelines.  With the integration into other platforms like SFDC, SLACK, and email, we can get these in front of them quickly to engage more rapidly while the accounts are actively looking for a solution in our category.
What they disliked about the product: The only gap is not being able to set filters for competitors and/or our own organizations' activity/signals on the G2 side.  Adding a filtering capability on the G2 platform side would be one thing I would highly recommend to help with some of the noise.

What they liked about the product: We're still ramping up our use. By far the best piece has been our account team. Both of the primary reps for us have been incredibly responsive and helpful. The interface is also fairly intuitive.

Review title: Above and beyond - always!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Where do I even start? I've had the pleasure of working with G2 for the past 2+ years, as I manage the organization's global review site program across 8+ markets. Never have I appreciated a partnership more - the level of attention, strategic support and responsiveness that the G2 team consistently delivers is unmatched. Not only are they always going above and beyond to nurture our partnership, but they never fail to keep our company's goals and strategic priorities at the forefront of their recommendations. Special shout out to Jeremy Levin, Kyle Miller and Megan Miedema - they are an absolute joy to work with and deliver nothing short of a first-class customer experience.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing, honestly. Any (very minor) issues that I've ever had have been promptly addressed, actioned on and resolved by the G2 team in a timely manner.

Review title: G2's Marketing Solutions provide the most relevant online "word of mouth"
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I've worked with G2 at multiple companies, the reason I still do business with G2 is the people. Every person I have ever spoken with at G2 is respectful, knowledgeable, and willing to answer tricky questions! 

On the product side, I've used the badges, the reports, and company grids, buyers' intent, lead generation forms, and reference pages.
What they disliked about the product: I wish there were a way to customize reference pages and review campaign pages to be a bit more on-brand with my company versus G2's brand.

But other than that there's nothing else i can think of. Everything has been great so over the years we've been using G2!

Review title: Fantastic platform to research potential companies and collect reviews for your own
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 interface is easy to use when building product profiles - there are a wide variety of avenues (descriptions, downloads, screen shots, videos, etc.) to provide information to potential customers, integrate with existing company systems to ensure leads route appropriately, and the G2 team has many great suggestions on how to encourage existing customers to review your products.
What they disliked about the product: Can't think of any negatives, with G2's continuous evolution of more features, supporting more integrations, and providing enhanced review strategies, they really are the leader for both customer feedback and honest product research. Keep doing what you're doing!

Review title: Capturing Emotions of our customers
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 has been a trusted partner in capturing our customers' voices & sharing them with a larger audience! 

G2 also provides insights on 'In-Market' audience who are potentially looking for a solution that we offer to solve.
What they disliked about the product: The speed of new updates / features can improve. We'd like to see more insights on Intent signals.

Review title: Great Support and CSM Team
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The CSM team was very helpful in setting up the account and helping with all the questions and doubts we had. One of the other things is the Banbora intent is also added in our intent data and makes it very easy to target accounts
What they disliked about the product: I am still skeptical about the market presence score in their quarterly reports.

Review title: Jack and John are HEROES!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to measure company success on reviews, working in tandem with the G2 team to create successful review campaigns, the people (John Sarhage and Jack Garvey) are OUTSTANDING in customer service, experience, and competence of the platform. They're setting us up for success, and teaching me how to effectively leverage the platform, read metrics, and increase our review responses.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing. Ya'll are the bomb. It's not something I dislike, and it probably exists somewhere I just haven't looked into it – a heat map of where people are stopping in their reviews. Perhaps I could make it easier on our customers with that type of information.

Review title: Great Experience
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I had a great experience speaking with Jack Smith about our options and opportunities with G2. Having worked and spoken with a lot of people in similar roles, I can confidently say Jack did an outstanding job. Took the time to do his research, asked lots of questions, listened carefully and overall made our interaction feel like a conversation rather than a sale. Well done!
What they disliked about the product: The pricing model isn't in line with what we are looking for at the moment.

Review title: Great buyer insights & helpful team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Have always used G2 as the source of truth for researching & comparing products. It has been a super useful tool on the flipside to position ourselves and help prospects understand if we'd be the right fit for them. Also a great place to capture feedback & insights from our current customers!
What they disliked about the product: There is a lot to work with, which can be overwhelming. Highly recommend taking a shared team approach to implementing G2. That being said, the G2 team is highly involved and super helpful.

Review title: Excellent customer success offering
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: To date we've been provided with friendly and thorough customer assistance. Will and Swati are always available to respond promptly to any questions we have. They are knowledgable about the product and make efforts to understand your market and provide examples of how best you can use the solutions on offer.
What they disliked about the product: The admin GUI is slightly too nested in places and it can be hard to navigate if you don't use it on a regular basis. It would be good too if the product categories were a little more granular as the one we are in is not 100% accurate for our market.

Review title: Highly recommend G2 Marketing Solutions!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 provides valuable insight into how we compare with our competitors, along with many great tools to enhance our visibility in the marketplace. Our customer success/relationship managers have been a huge help in finding new and creative ways to boost our presence (thank you Kaylan and Dani!!).
What they disliked about the product: Our position on the grid isn't necessarily 100% accurate, but that's not entirely a G2 issue. Other than that, there's not much to dislike!

Review title: An excellent reviews-and-social proof platform - driving signups and demos for our software!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: What I like best about G2's Marketing Solutions is the dedicated support you get from your Account Manager / Account Executive. They ensure that you get your G2 account set up for maximum impact, and also provide best-practice insights on how to drive authentic, stellar reviews from your customers. Their quarterly reports are also great 'milestones' to plan your review-growth goals by, as they give you something to 'aim for' in your efforts to grow your G2 presence.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes the internal Admin menu setup is a little confusing to navigate. I guess that this is partially because of how many features/options G2 has, but perhaps this could be laid out a little better. Also, some of the ranking metrics G2 uses to place your company in the rankings for appropriate categories don't always seem to relate to product maturity. I.e. the number of employees in a company. I understand that this can, at times, impact product quality, but at the same time - a large company doesn't an excellent product make!

Review title: the project team is always happy to help
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: some options that are available in our plan help us find new leads. Also, the reviews written by our clients add more credibility to the company, especially the badges that we are using on our website and in our promo spaces, in presentations and other ads visuals.
What they disliked about the product: I do not like that the information about the written and rejected reviews is hidden. There have been several instances where reviews written by our clients have been rejected for no good reason. In case there are controversial issues with the review, it would be better to transparently resolve them directly with the product team.
The market Presence Scoring algorithm is a bit 'blurry'. We can't directly influence this and your position on the G2 grid.
Very long questionnaire, please make it lightweight because it is difficult to get customers to go through all the pages of the questionnaire in order for the review to be qualified for the report.
Also, make screenshot a required field, because it's optional now and clients don't add it, but it's a reason for you to reject the review.

Review title: Great experience with G2!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Working with dedicated account managers to help us get the most out of generating reviews and our profile on the platform in general.
What they disliked about the product: There isn't much I can say I dislike about G2. It is an expensive service, but the service you get really makes it value for money, so while I would like it to be cheaper, it isn't because I think its over-priced.

Review title: Amazing services and support, highly recommend it!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I am fortunate to work with such a fantastic team. The features we were offered are excellent and new innovations are always coming out. I strongly believe that this is due to the hard-working team at G2, of which I can single out the amazing Abhilash Chowdhury and Matthieu Le Sayec.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing I can pinpoint or think of at this moment.

Review title: G2 team is super Professional, Attentive & Responsive

What they liked about the product: From the moment we reached out to G2, we received outstanding service. Our customer success manager is always there to help and answer any questions we might have with a personal touch. She cares about us and goes out of her way to ensure we use the platform to its maximum potential, pointing out features we weren't aware of and solving any issues we might have very quickly.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing I dislike. I'm pleased with the service.

Review title: Great platform for B2b reviews and buyer incentive data

Collecting and using reviews in our campaigns and landing pages has proved to help raising our conversion rates.
What they disliked about the product: There's not that much to dislike. However, there are a few navigational things that could be improved a bit when signed in - but that's usually because I forget where they are. 

The second thing might be that getting the credit card receipt is a bit complicated when you buy buyer incentive credits from Amazon. We have to go through our rep. to get it. That would be nice to get automatically sent to us. 
But I believe they are working on fixing some of this.

Review title: Full featured review platform
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The level of detail with regards to the feedback is very good. The grid view and industry specific comparisons are great.
What they disliked about the product: Collecting review requires substantial effort as it is quite demanding on the customers.

Review title: Expert Solutions with a Smile
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We love the friendly, positive attitude of all the G2 employees we've encountered. The follow-ups and the problem-solving have been above and beyond. 
The backend user experience of the platform is easy to navigate and simple to perform updates and changes of content etc.
What they disliked about the product: There is a lot going on, lots of new integrations, always lots of news - that sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming. Maybe some kind of a monthly news reel, like a quick roundup, could be produced and sent out instead of so much static content.

Review title: Kudos to G2 from Product to CS
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: From campaign automation to ideating on creative review program initiatives with my CSM, Edan, G2 is a key driver in our competitive reviews program. The platform enables a great overview of testimonials and also sentiment tracking.
What they disliked about the product: I would love to be able to create my own reports to pull, as to reduce daily comms with my CSM, although he's quick to reply.

Review title: Great solution and top-notch team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 has been a great help to our marketing and RFP team. 
Definitely adds a layer of trust when our potential buyers are making purchasing decision.
It was a real pleasure working with the whole CSM team - Jade, Edan and Matthieu.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing at all. The solution is great and it was a pleasure working with the team

Review title: Great review platform, with fast approval process and many insightful reports!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like the fact that our customers' reviews get approved pretty fast and that we can get a lot of interesting comparison reports that we can later share.
What they disliked about the product: The interface isn't that user-friendly, and some things are a bit hard to find.

Review title: Great tool that helps us leverage customer advocacy
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Very straightforward process for review campaigns - from the start of the campaign to the reimbursement - definitely a competitive advantage over some other similar platforms.
In addition, the G2 team we've worked with has always been very knowledgeable and responsive, something that everyone working in CS appreciates ;)
What they disliked about the product: The navigation around the admin portal can be confusing and sometimes takes a bit of time to find what I'm looking for.

Review title: High quality review site: helps leverage social proof for sales and marketing
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 maintains high quality of both categorizationa and reviews, which helps leveraging it for marketing efforts to drive impact. 
The customer service is the best I've ever worked with, helping us make the most out of G2 services.
What they disliked about the product: The pricing is not aleays clear, with additional cost for certain features.

Review title: Great marketing solution to engage with customers and help prospects on their research journey
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: With G2, you get access to a leader grid and reviews that can be integrated across all marketing content from the website to paid social etc. It's an excellent platform to help increase credibility with prospects, increase engagement and build relationships with current clients. The customer support team is fantastic. Lucy and Pramila are always there to help support, brainstorm and develop ideas. In addition, they bring a positive vibe to every meeting, and their response time is prompt.
What they disliked about the product: Not a dislike - it would be beneficial to have more visual versions of the G2 content for our marketing

Review title: Great customer success team and useful insights
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2's customer success team is excellent; they're always coming up with new ways to share our badges and promote our profile. You can add a wide variety of content to your profile and there are a number of useful integrations.
What they disliked about the product: The category we're in can sometimes feels a bit broad or unaudited, meaning sometimes our G2 competitors aren't always our actual competitors. This means our insights, at times, can be irrelevant. As a consumer, I think the layout is good, but if you're logged in as a product admin, I think it can be tricky to navigate and doesn't have a very easy-to-understand layout.

Review title: Great Platform and Even Better Support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 has helped put our company in the "shop window" and provided a place where our customers can shout about how good our product is! The support when running a campaign was first class, with our account manager going the extra mile
What they disliked about the product: The only thing I would highlight is there were a few issues with incentives being reimbursed to customers on our campain first time round, although this was a small number and was resolved by the team at G2

Review title: Excellent platform and great support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Running reviews campaigns is easy, and the account management team is always on top of it and willing to go the extra mile to help us achieve our goals.
What they disliked about the product: The pricing is a bit steep, especially for the intent data. While the data is excellent, there isn't the full functionality in the platform or integrations to make it easy to make the most of it.

Review title: Fantastic Customer Success Support ✨
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Since purchasing the paid membership to G2 and pushing the launch campaign live, the success was staggering and beyond our expectations. The best part is the Customer Success because you are in partnership with an expert and they are always on hand to support/recommend. Every question I've had answered and they share recaps, updates - the communication is second to none. They are also a great bunch of people.
What they disliked about the product: I find the G2 backend a little overwhelming and difficult to navigate; it would be good if this could be simplified. I also initially found our discovery call a little underwhelming as the Salesperson wasn't overly engaging, but I think this was a one-off. Planning the campaign(s) and exploring the tool takes time, so you will need to set aside sufficient time.

Review title: I definitely recommend G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: - It's a very intuitive and easy-to-use tool. 
- The team Edan and Matthieu are always very reactive and helpful. 
- The signals we get from G2 are very insightful.
What they disliked about the product: I'm quiet happy with the tool. What is missing is that we don't have the buying stage of the companies in the detailed CSV.

Review title: Great Customer Success Team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The customer success team have helped my company, Kluster.com , to maximise the value from G2 Marketing Solutions. Edan and Clare have been attentive and helped me with everything from the basics of how to navigate the platform to tips on encouraging our customers to leave reviews. The platform itself is intuitive and easy to use and has all of the resources that we need right there.
What they disliked about the product: One thing that I would like to see is a breakdown of how G2 scores and ranks the solutions on the platform. I understand, however, that this might lead to some people exploiting the system and so it not a huge deal.

Review title: The one and the only review site!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Our customer success managers Henry and Mark are constantly helping us get the most out of the platform and improving our profile. It's a very trusted source and helps us buildning creditability in our community. We also find the buyer intent data very useful as well as the integrations with LinkedIn and HubSpot.
What they disliked about the product: That there are no specific badges for each category eg. if you are a leader in multiple categories you still just get one badge. Nothing else that I can think about :)

Review title: Great advice and communication that delivers results
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Lucy and Ben are very efficient. They always provide us with accurate and up-to-date intel that helps us ensure we are on the right track for our own G2 reviews.
What they disliked about the product: Some of the review criteria can be a bit confusing in how it's displayed in the grid standings and results.

Review title: I love working with G2!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 employs some of the most professional customer success professionals I've worked with. Shoutout to Jade Cass and Siobhan Murphy!
What they disliked about the product: I love G2 and consider it the most reliable platform for customer reviews.

Review title: Great service, lots of tools, awesome client care.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's great that the marketing solutions offer so many different ways to showcase your success - badges, widgets, so many ways, all covered by the badge of trust of the G2 brand.
What they disliked about the product: I think it's a shame that the premium membership price is quite steep for smaller companies that could also greatly benefit from the marketing tools. Even we had to give it a second and third thought before proceeding.

Review title: Our cooperation was really helpful.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: They explained everything to us, clearly showed us. When we didn't understand something, we went back to it and it was explained to us again.
What they disliked about the product: I find this service expensive for small businesses. It would be nice to be able to try the G2 for a few days for free with all the features. Sometimes I find G2 confusing and I have to search for things in it.

Review title: training with CS G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I think it is very interesting to have users' opinions to really evaluate a company
as a CS, all my work is focused on ensuring a good experience for our users, and having their point of view and their encouragement via G2 is a very good way to value our work
What they disliked about the product: the real difficulty is obtaining reviews. It takes a lot of time to encourage our client teams and get them involved in this mission. It is not easy to get reviews from people who are not directly impacted because they are not employees of our company.

But it's a high value-added job, so we have to take it seriously

Review title: G2 exceeds all expectations!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's amazing how many useful features the G2 platform has. Most of them you can easily use in a few clicks. Well-thought-through and organized information and step-by-step manuals make it easy to navigate the platform by yourself. And tones of case studies and examples shared by the team in comprehensive guides make it easier to navigate through the variety of ways you can use G2.

But the most important is the G2 team working with you. They are professionals that help you to get the maximum from your experience. In some way, it feels like you reinforced your own team with new members who generate ideas of what else could be done to improve your marketing results and even do part of your job (like outreach and so on). Fantastic!
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really. 

In the beginning, it's a bit confusing to understand what's exactly included in each plan if you're unfamiliar with the names of the platform's features (as there're many of them). It's not a disadvantage, as your managers will eventually walk you through them. But I would recommend that all who think about using G2 on a pro level invest a bit of their time learning what's in the admin panel to ensure better understanding from the beginning.

Review title: Great platform and an even better team!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Being the largest tech marketplace, it gives a unique opportunity to find the software you require for specific needs, plus the trust that it will measure to expectations thanks to the unbaised and authentic reviews left by real users. On the other side, working with G2 to list our company within their different categories, build trust in the community and showcase our unique product has been a very rewarding experience. Their team is always on top of everything and is ready to help in anything that might come up.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing so far, we are currently developing our project, and everyone has been very responsive. Even when, from our side, there have been some doubts about how to leverage our presence, the G2 team has been there in every step to demonstrate the value and how we can profit from it.

Review title: Excellent support and care from the G2 team
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: For me as good as the platform is for helping us showcase our product, it's the wrap-around support and care that really helps G2 to shine. Our account team are super supportive and the monthly call really allows us to get the most out of the platform. 

For the platform itself, most things are super simple and intuitive which makes getting to grips with it quick and easy.
What they disliked about the product: Beyond a few minor UI tweaks here and there (which are quite subjective) there isn't anything really I'd use the word dislike for. It's be great to be able to have a bit of a trial of some of the more advanced features looked away behind a license upgrade.

Review title: Working with G2: positive experience and helpful CSMs
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is now a very well-known platform - especially for SaaS software: it helps us to feature our product in software categories and gives us visibility against competitors. Our CSMs are also very friendly and always eager to help! 
Something that I like best on G2: they help us drive quarterly review campaigns, which help us to increase in ranking. Their badge and grid also get nowadays a lot of recognition from prospects.
What they disliked about the product: G2 is not as known outside the US: for G2 to matter most with our FR and ES customers, I think that it should work on becoming more international, as right now the badges and position on the grids are mostly recognized by US, UKI customers.

Review title: Great marketing opportunities for vendors on the platform
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Working with G2 has been a breeze. Their innovative tools and platform allow us to remain at the forefront of our industry. Their team is always on hand to help out and provide best practices.
What they disliked about the product: G2 is a fantastic platform for gathering authentic reviews. However, this strict process of gathering genuine reviews makes it longer for users to share their feedback. Reviews are often rejected.

Review title: Great platform and great advice
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to compare your product against others both in terms of customer experience and market presence from within a comprehensive dashboardI
What they disliked about the product: Updates to some scoring only occur monthly rather than in real-time

Review title: G2 offers unique crowd sourced content options for marketers
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The more reviews gathered, the more functionality is unlocked, such as additional marketing content and the ability to create landing pages to curate your reviews.
What they disliked about the product: It is too easy for random pages to be created for your products, and even if they are unadopted, customers do not know that whicht can impact search results

Review title: It's been great collaborating with the G2 team in the past couple of years
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Great customer service team. Very responsive and positive.
What they disliked about the product: I believe the price for the reports is too expensive. Also not being able to use them after the subscription ended seems unfair considering you paid for it.

Review title: Actually helpful conversations
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The friendly atmosphere on calls. Combined with product knowledge and great follow-up. I'm newer to using G2 as a promotional tool but enjoying the options to explore.
What they disliked about the product: There is a little uncertainty about reports and how they are calculated. Understandable that it's not totally on display but more heads up comms before deadline would be helpful.

Review title: A lack of reviews makes buyers less likely to buy. Here's where G2 comes into play.
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Online reviews help consumers make purchasing decisions.
What they disliked about the product: At times I feel G2 is browsed more by competitors than actual buyers.

Review title: Great experience and stellar account managers
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We've been running a G2 campaign and our account managers, Henry and Mark, helped us immensely throughout our journey. It's been a great and smooth experience. All our concerns were addressed timely and properly. During frequent calls with Henry and Mark, we had a chance to ask any questions we had and discuss our strategy. Overall, it was an enormous pleasure working with such professional account managers. The platform itself is great as well.
What they disliked about the product: I don't think we had any serious troubles while running our campaign.

Review title: Beating your competition
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: First and most important are the team that is assigned to the project with you. We were lucky to have the best team Mark and Henry are doing amazing work with us. They also go deeper into our employees, teaching them the importance of reviews. The result was not late to come.
What they disliked about the product: The TTV is longer than expected. We are investing in this project cross-company effort (worth it, of course), but we were not ready to make sure huge investments at first now we want to invest more than we first started. The system works !!!

Review title: A must-have channel for all scaling software businesses
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The biggest plus for us has been using reviews to help prospective buyers understand how we have helped existing customers in similar ways. Being able to show our strengths vs competitors on a macro and micro level also helps. The G2 team is also very helpful in educating us on best practices.
What they disliked about the product: There is not much to dislike. G2 is always expanding ways to collect and leverage reviews.

Review title: One of the most trustworthy platforms
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 offers a dedicated team of account managers and a variety of useful features.
What they disliked about the product: Although the paid plan is a little pricey, the platform has many capabilities.

Review title: G2 lets up capture and leverage the voice of our customers
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is easy to manage and offers loads of functionality to let your brand shine. I love how easy it is to set up incentivized landing pages to reward customers for their feedback. Beyond generating reviews, G2 provides strong competitive intelligence & research reports and comes packed with powerful marketing integrations. The ability to create reference pages and competitor comparisons is also very powerful and valued by our sales team. Finally, the G2 team is super helpful and knowledgeable!
What they disliked about the product: I would love to have more options for exporting reviews to run analyses.

Review title: New growth engines - ✅
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Ever since we started using G2 (and built our company page) we started receiving many new leads from all around the world. The great advantage of G2 is the indexing of its categories on Google. That means that whenever someone searches "The Best Privacy Software for Businesses", they will get to Mine PrivacyOps pretty quickly. In addition, the seasonal badges and awards are great for our brand trust.
What they disliked about the product: A bit expensive, but what can you do! The value is insane here!

Review title: Helpful and dedicated Customer Success Manager!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The G2 Marketing team is fantastic. Mark and Henry are professionals, which helps us to meet our business goals.
We keep gaining value from our meetings and appreciate the immediate care of the outputs.
The personal touch helps us to increase our value on the G2 website.
What they disliked about the product: Some of the reports weren't 100% clear to me, but our dedicated CSM quickly returned to us with clarifications.

Review title: Great review platform!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: C'est une plateforme simple d'utilisation avec beaucoup de leviers qui nous permettent de donner de la visibilité à notre marque et générer des nouveaux leads / accelerer notre pipe. L'accompagnement des équipes est également top qualité!
What they disliked about the product: Pas de vrais inconvénients à relever pour le moment.

Review title: We ❤️ G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The best thing is that G2 helps new, high-quality prospects find us at a great price. The next best thing is that they do it as part of a genuine partnership with us, supporting us every step of the way. I know that Mark and Henry have my back, and they consistently go above and beyond to help us reach our goals.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing much to dislike! It would be cool if they had the option to translate our profile into different languages.

Review title: A great tool for marketing and communication on an international scale
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The team was always willing to go above and beyond to find ideas and fixes to increase success.

Review title: Great marketplace for showcasing your software solutions
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The EMEA Customer Success team have been very engaging and supportive in helping us utilise the platform
What they disliked about the product: It can be quite time-consuming and taxing to create and maintain profiles, especially if limited on resources

Review title: Great CS team, powerful tool!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The buyer intent tools - these are particularly useful to our BD team, and even to marketing when profiling our ICP.
What they disliked about the product: It's not a dislike but it would be super handy if we could connect buyer intent signals with Slack.

Review title: Cannot believe I ever ran ABM without it
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It has became as strong of a channel as our own website. Especially on the higher echelon prospects side (b2b, abm).
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to report. All has been working smoothly.

Review title: Easy to use

What they disliked about the product: It can be expensive for smaller companies

Review title: Brilliant experience
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We are fascinated by the Buyer Intent feature as it helps a lot our Marketing and Sales teams. It gives a lot of insights that help market to the right prospect at the right time and close deals faster.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing, to be honest. We are completely satisfied with it.

Review title: Helpful team, easy platform to navigate
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: In general, I find the platform rather easy to navigate, and the team responds quickly when I have doubts.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing I dislike. I should dedicate more time to take full advantage.

Review title: Great onboarding experience with G2
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We've only been using the platform actively for some months. But so far it's actually the personal help that we have received during the onboarding which has been the best part of the experience. I should also add that the Product portal is very valuable and contains a lot of useful information and material for marketing.
What they disliked about the product: I would have loved to be able to customize the page that people get to when they start to write a review, being able to describe the process a bit further so the person knows what steps they need to go through in order to submit a review.

Review title: Great support from the G2 team!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: All the help from the G2 team during our onboarding process. They have shared insights on how to best use the G2 features to maximize the value from the solution, and also shared tips on how to encourage our customers to leave reviews.
What they disliked about the product: Not much to dislike, but sometimes the possibility to customize pages and information even more.

Review title: More than just reviews – G2 gives tangible insights
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is one of the first places software buyers go to learn about your product these days, so it really gives us an opportunity to showcase our product and the amazing users we have.

But it's more than just reviews, the buyer intent information and other analytics are helpful to not only create leads, but also move opportunities through the pipeline.

To cap it off, their customer success and accounts team are second to none. I've worked with a number of reps at different organizations across  a number locations and each and every one of them have been proactive and a pleasure to work with.
What they disliked about the product: Occasionally the backend UI will have some quirks that get resolved (like lists not scrolling the way I expect, or buttons not leading to where I think they should lead), but even these get resolved rather quickly.

Review title: Amazing customer experience & awareness for your brand
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing solutions are very professional. They provide excellent account management, various profile features and last, but not least, they provide quality traffic & leads to your SaaS solutions.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike really, we are very satisfied.

Review title: G2 Marketing Solutions has helped scale our marketing efforts
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The best part of working with G2 Marketing Solutions is building out your company profile, allowing our own prospects to gain information and see real-world feedback and reviews from our customers.
What they disliked about the product: There's not much to dislike, but I wish our company profile page would be a little more customizable. I'm also not a bug fan of the 'discussions' section as you are nto allowed to curate your own FAQs.

Review title: Great exposure tool
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I like the information and dashboards provided
What they disliked about the product: Nothing in specific that is serious, maybe some extra info on how to obtain more reviews

Review title: An insightful platform with great support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The peer-review-led aspect of how G2 ranks solutions helps to provide a greater validity to our software and its offering.  Despite needing a large upfront payment, it tends to prove more cost-effective in the long term than some of the biddable PPC directories, where you ultimately end up driving up the PPC every month but the number of clicks and leads remain the same.

Our account and customer success managers, Austin and Michael, have both been great in helping us to optimise our profile and get the most out of our G2 package.

Also, really like the new profile sections in the software categories, with the addition of extra data and ratings info.
What they disliked about the product: Price increase for renewal was quite a jump in 2022, which wasn't ideal.

Gathering reviews can be difficult due to the need for customers to have to log into G2 in order for them to be validated.  Obviously we understand the need to ensure reviews are genuine and of high quality, but we do get regular push-back from our customers who are willing to leave a review, but have abandoned their review or just won't complete one due to the login requirement and length of the questionnaire.  The screenshot aspect in particular has proved an annoyance for many.

It's a shame badges awarded to software providers are not displayed alongside each providers profile on the software category list.  It'd be a great addition to add extra kudos to profiles.

Review title: Good intent data and powerful content from the real customers
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The access to all different reports, data, reviews, and awards. Plus our BDR team really appreciate the intent data.
What they disliked about the product: I would love to creat custom dashboards and reports on my own, not always asking the Customer Success Manager.

Review title: Brilliant support team, easy onboarding and quick ROI
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The G2 vendor portal is super easy to use, and the onboarding/ongoing support we've received from the customer success team has been one of the best we've experienced. We hit our initial review target within the first three months of our contract and were awarded the  'High Performer' badge, which has already helped us generate sales-ready leads and beat our competitors to several deals.
What they disliked about the product: Haven't found much to dislike so far. The only improvement I'd suggest is in the widget area - G2 has some of the best review widgets around, but it would be great to have more customisation options to help keep these on-brand when embedding on our website.

Review title: G2 provides great market insight
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: G2 grids are very helpful when it comes to seeing where you are placed against competitors.
What they disliked about the product: When giving a review you have to have a G2 account, if you don't you need to create one before you can leave a review. I feel like is a sticking point for customers.

Review title: Wonderful customer experience with useful tool
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: In my opinion, the most helpful thing we've seen from G2 so far is identifying where we can work on our product. We haven't been working with G2 for too long so I can't comment on the overall benefits yet but so far its been helpful.
What they disliked about the product: Something that could be improved upon in my experience so far with G2 is the availability of offerings based on the price point. In my opinion its quite an investment and for that investment I believe you should get more access to portions of the tool.

Review title: Quick support and share of best practices
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Great support from the customer success team and sharing of best practices suitable for our situation.
What they disliked about the product: No significant downsides have been experienced so far.

Review title: G2 Helps Our Company Close Enterprise Deals
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions has provided our company with personalized support and consistently beneficial tactics as to how to maximize our efforts on G2. Their non-PPC model works best for our business.
What they disliked about the product: Product-wise there is nothing I would look to improve at this time. Cost however, is always a factor in our decisions and G2 has a premium offering.

Review title: Must have tool for SaaS marketing teams
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is honest about ranking companies in the categories - regardless if you're paying or not - your position is based on your reviews. This is the best thing you can do for your organic traffic without needing to publish content on your own. Just be ranked high in your category in G2. Also, if you do decide to become a paying customer for GH2 then the support team and account managers really put in effort to make sure you succeed.
What they disliked about the product: Some small glitches on the dashboard but nothing that your account manager can't help you with. Can't really think about anything else that I dislike.

Review title: Great review generation tool
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 help us gather and showcase our product (MightyCall) reviews. Grid reports are fantastic as well. The customer success team is the best!
What they disliked about the product: It would be great to have more widgets we can place on our website

Review title: A Truly Helpful Partnership
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Out of my many calls with vendors, software tools, etc., I always know my check-in calls with G2 will be worthwhile. I feel like we're able to address specific issues and objectives as well as plan for more strategic projects.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing comes to mind, to be honest. It does seem like G2 swaps teams regularly, which changes our Account Manager(s). But overall, we tend to end up with another good Account Manager, so it's not a huge issue.

What they liked about the product: I get a great deal of information from G2's research reports.
What they disliked about the product: The website structure is a little bit complex.

Review title: Productive partnership and collaboration with G2 EMEA client success team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: High availability; very responsive; professional individuals; always follows up on progress, and above all, result-driven and genuinely success-oriented CSM team.
What they disliked about the product: Some technical and integrations-related challenges require escalation to tier 2 support that may take time to sync and resolve efficiently. Lack of sufficient online documentation, best practices and/or case studies for specific use cases involving Hubspot buyer intent integration.

Review title: The best platform to capture high intent prospects
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solution provides us with a platform and tools to authorize us as a leader within our field, as well as giving us one of the best channels to capture high intent prospects.
What they disliked about the product: I can't really see any downsides with using this platform. The results all comes down to you as a user.

Review title: A review based on my experience working with G2 for the past couple of months
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 platform lets us collect honest reviews and display our product features in one place. It has proved to be very powerful for our sales team.
What they disliked about the product: The website is completely unusable on mobile when logged into admin mode.

Review title: Excellent platform for B2B reviews!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: It's a great way to get customer feedback on your product and services. Jatin and Ben from G2 have been super helpful too! Always on hand to offer support and advice as we look for ways to improve our review generation efforts and profile.
What they disliked about the product: We had a trial of the Buyer Intent Tool included in our first G2 package, which we didn't find as beneficial as other similar tools that we use already in this area.

Review title: Our preferred review partner
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I love the intuitive dashboard. Important metrics are at your fingertips, and most of what you need is readily accessible. I also love the team. They are responsive and really take the time to work with you on achieve better results.
What they disliked about the product: Although there is access to many metrics, it would be great to have a better overview of performance in ALL categories rather than having to view the data for one category at a time. It would also be great to have some comparative reporting and a build-your-own report feature.

Review title: Simple, intuitive and empowered by a 10/10 team!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 helps me to have a very good market overview. From a product admin point of view, it gives me valuable insights into my product. Great way to identify advocates as well. From a user standpoint, is. The best place to find the right tool to equip my team with the right tech stack. The CSM team is also amazing. I had the pleasure of working with Jade and Jasmine and I only have good things to say about both.
What they disliked about the product: There's not much I dislike about G2, the platform works great. It would be great to have a more complete overview on what are the missing pieces that could be affecting product performance - for example showing that our online presence was not strong enough this quarter, etc.

Review title: G2 is kind of necessary when it comes to B2B software
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: I really like the professional support that you get from the customer success team from G2. They will come up with ideas, best practices and more to help or even design the whole review strategy with you.
What they disliked about the product: One thing that I dont link is the fact, that you can not chance or edit the questions that are asked in the review process. That means for some of our users, we can not send them the review campaign, because they will be confused by and can not answer all the questions.

Review title: Excellent Support, A Great Platform
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 team provide excellent support and have been a great help in securing our new reviews and badges.
What they disliked about the product: When we started on G2, it seemed we got a new account manager every other month (all extremely friendly) it was difficult to build a relationship, but, now it seems to be more stable and we have great communication with our current managers.

Review title: Love working with G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: You can trust G2! They ensure that the responses are reliable, so it's one of the tools I trust the most! 
Also, their level of service is fantastic; you feel like G2 is a true partner in your success.
What they disliked about the product: Not much; sometimes it's challenging to understand where to find the data you are looking fro as an Admin. But for that we have our great CS team and they are always available :)

Review title: Excellent leads generator to boost our SaaS business
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The tool is straightforward to use, and I can get a lot of insights from profile visitors. The fact that you can see when they visited our site and G2, says a lot.
What they disliked about the product: I don't dislike anything about the tool; I think you are continuously developing it and releasing a lot of new features. When starting to use the tool, we had some change management-related issues, like how to get started internally. Now we are up and running, and with the support from G2, we are really improving.

Review title: Great customer support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Besides being a great platform to build credibility and trust for a brand, G2 also offers quarterly reports that our team are yet to discover (but very much looking forward).

The best thing about G2 though is their team's amazing customer support and service. Our customer support manager Michael Lydon is not only incredibly quick to respond with valuable advice and guidance regarding our questions, but also proactive in reaching out to us himself offering new ideas and support on how we can leverage the customer review collection process and build our profile in the most effective way. Always friendly and available for a chat, Michael sets a standard for customer service across other platforms that we engage with.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes reviews (especially video reviews) take longer than expected to get past moderation and become public. 

The platform offers a lot of marketing and promotion opportunities, which is great but can be overwhelming at times. This requires the necessary level of platform understanding to define priorities as well as additional resources (for a startup of our size and stage) from our team to allocate to the platform, which is often hard to find or specifically dedicate to.

Review title: Super great tool!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a great system QBank work with frequently within sales, marketing and soon support. Great support, do always have good tips on how to work even better with generating leads etc.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing I dislike about the system. It is pretty advanced and sometimes hard to understand how to maximize, but I'm always learning new things from G2 and how I can improve my work in the system.

Review title: Lead generation mixed with all the goodies
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The top 3 things about G2 Marketing Solutions are the leads it brings directly from the platform, the intent data we can couple with native advertising software, and the badges/reports we can use in our marketing campaigns. This tool is optimal for someone who likes to automate processes as it is easy to integrate with other software. G2 also has a fantastic customer success team that helps you get the most out of your experience and the resources you pay for.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing so far, it's easy to use, and it has brought us concrete results.

Review title: You get hot leads
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: That you can see what company is looking for your product at the moment.
What they disliked about the product: That you don't see which person or role the person who's been on your G2 site or are looking for your product in general.

Review title: G2 is the most reliable and trustworthy platform for reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The supporting team are great, and the platform is nice and clear
What they disliked about the product: It sometimes gets hard to increase our usability in everything the platform offers. I would like to have a more precise onboarding to understand the features better.

Review title: Important element of our marketing communications through promotion of reviews, grids, indexes, etc.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Lots of opportunities for content repurposing through reviews, badges, grids, and awards. The very helpful account managers provide recommendations for G2 marketing.
What they disliked about the product: There are restrictions on content repurposing related to licensing.

Review title: Working with the team at G2 has been a pleasure from day one
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The fact that all the reports are vetted and verified by G2 gives credibility to the badges and reports. When a prospect or customer wants to research our service, we feel confident pointing them to G2 for reliable and honest info about our product. The team is also really helpful and supportive, providing plenty of ideas and examples of how we can use the content.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really comes to mind about the Marketing Solutions themselves, but gathering reviews is key to the success of the marketing material, and some customers express that writing a review can be time-consuming, so that's one thing I guess I can say I dislike. That said, having a slightly higher threshold for review writers is what ensures they're real and credible, so I probably wouldn't want to change it even if it's a bit of a hurdle for some.

Review title: The best way to collect customer feedback
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 allows us to collect customer feedback, better understand the market, and develop our product based on it. We also use the buyer intent features to support our outbound sales efforts. The CSM team has been extremely helpful and responsive in supporting us with review campaigns, onboarding, and any of our questions. They regularly go above and beyond to get our questions answered quickly.
What they disliked about the product: Because the scoring algorithm for the grid and rankings change all the time, it's sometimes difficult to keep track of all the things we could be doing to perform better in the reports. However, the CSM team has done a great job keeping us up to date on the important changes.

The other thing I'd love would be the ability to control what data/new accounts we move to HubSpot through the integration. In its current shape, the integration is a bit noisy.

Review title: Customer Success Team is Beyond the Expectations!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: As a platform with more than 20 million users around the world, the G2 marketplace helps people so much to discover useful tools, compare them with other platforms, and leave honest reviews. The grids are also very helpful. What I like the most is the approach of the Customer Success team, and how caring and responsive they are.
What they disliked about the product: Can't mention anything so far. Even if any issue/question arises, the team supports and answers our questions immediately.

Review title: Excellent website

Review title: G2 helps us with our A-game 🏆
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We've been working with G2 for some time as a platform for credible information for prospective customers. As we work to help clients unlock the next level of growth in their business, G2 helps us do the same. 🚀
The support and customer success team (Mark and Henry) are always on hand to help us improve and scale up.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes it takes a little while for us to get our reviews reviewed.

Review title: Great customer support experience
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Any time we have some questions about the functionality or need some assistance, the team is quick to help and propose suitable solutions. It does not always work out, but I appreciate the effort and responsiveness. Also, we've found out that 50% of our deals have been, to some extent, influenced by our profile on G2 - I think that speaks for itself.
What they disliked about the product: This is very specific, but I would appreciate greater integrability with our sales/customer success tech stack. Some of the connectors are there but require manual mapping of contacts, which we do not have the time for.

Review title: G2 works like Crack but better (and more legal)
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's the best tool there is to gather reviews for your application. This way you have a nice overview of what your clients think. Also the grids that are available make you want to do better than your competitors on a daily basis. Mark is a true star as a CSM
What they disliked about the product: Nothing much. Sometimes the moderation takes ages, but then again it's because I'm impatient.

Review title: Use for sales leads

What they liked about the product: Automated process of receiving leads and insights.
What they disliked about the product: I wish there was room for more context from the leads.

Review title: Amazing channel to target the high intent prospects
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love how granular I can get with the targeting - such as I can target people who visited my company page differently than the people who visited the company category
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really! it does everything I expect

Review title: G2 helps us drive leads and improve our market presence
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The review process is trustworthy. 
They have very strict review requirements that are important for quality.
What they disliked about the product: The market presence scoring puts too much emphasis on the number of employees in a company. This has nothing to do with the quality of the product or service. On the contrary- a small company that has many good reviews with fewer employees is probably better than a big company.

Review title: Friendly customer service
Rating: 2.5
What they liked about the product: We enjoy the possibilities we have with G2 – whether badges, reviews, or brand awareness (especially in international markets). It's a good resource to gather honest feedback from our customers.
What they disliked about the product: However, all the functionalities we can use with the paid version have not yet sparked a lot of enthusiasm in our company. For example, you don't see why a review has been rejected, there's not much going on concerning intent data, and for paid promotions (ads in your category) you need to pay extra PLUS you have to make sure to secure your spot before your competitor, which hasn't been a pleasant experience so far...especially because there wasn't much traffic generated either by these ads.

Review title: Poor quality data and lack of support
Rating: 0.5
What they liked about the product: The reviews aspect of G2 is quite good. It is a useful way to gain feedback for our Customer Success Team, although an internal, more affordable system would likely suffice.
What they disliked about the product: The intent data is often incorrect or irrelevant. There seems to be a number of issues with the platform over the past several months where the dashboard doesn't work properly and provides inconsistent data.
The dashboard often ignores our ICP/Vertical settings and provides data on irrelevant companies. This causes issues with our ABM strategy.
G2's Customer Success/Relationship Team are unhelpful and have litle to no understanding of their own platform. They often make promises to follow up on our issues but never do. 
Recently our Customer Success and Relationship Managers dumped us and passed us on to a new Manager who has not taken any time to work with us.

Review title: It's been wonderful collaborating with G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 reports are insightful and the relationship managers assigned to me are excellent!
What they disliked about the product: Nothing as of now other than time crunch.

Review title: G2 is a great platform giving your brand visibility
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The platform is well laid out both on the user interface and the external platform that prospective customers can use to find services and understand what other customers are saying. The support from customer success is great too.
What they disliked about the product: A couple of times reviews have taken a while to be moderated, more than a week.

Review title: Great review website with dedicated professionals
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 gives our marketing a tremendous boost. We display our milestones and badges achieved on almost every page of our website. We also use our rankings and badges in other marketing and sales collateral like presentations, documentation, and visuals. Unlike other review websites, G2 is very user-friendly, innovative, and brings us as a software vendor a lot of creditability by our customers and prospects. I also love working with our account managers at g2, everyone is very involved, thinking with us, and very helpful!
What they disliked about the product: The G2 algorithm that calculates your Market Presence Scoring is a bit 'blurry'. It is quite challenging to directly influence this and your position on the G2 grid. Your score or position on the grid can also vary from day to day.

Review title: Good insights and more invisibility onto the nuances that usually go unnoticed in the sales cycle
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 helps us have insights into the little things that go unnoticed throughout the sales cycle. It is hard to attribute successes and impact in a world where everything is connected. Being able to share what our customers love about us and use that intent data helps us understand what is effective in our processes and our product.
What they disliked about the product: I don't have much to complain about. It is hard to directly attribute revenue to a product like this, but our company does believe that it makes sense given our holistic marketing approach.

Review title: Transparent and we
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We were happy to see the results early on. Our managers Henry and Mark advised us on the best practices of collecting reviews and, once we'd collected those, the badges came in quickly. The onboarding was easy and straightforward, and our queries were resolved quickly. There's a feeling that our G2 managers really care about our business interests and experience with the platform. Overall, a very positive experience.
What they disliked about the product: G2 is very clear at communicating what it is and what it is not. It delivers on its promise, so there's nothing to say here.

Review title: The best guide to SaaS reviews out there
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: easy to navigate as a user and merchant!
What they disliked about the product: Nothing - i love the platform and how easy it is to use

Review title: Great onboarding and support, and lots of value to be found within the platform.
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The intent platform is a useful tool for finding in-market prospective buyers, and having access to marketing materials really helps add credibility to your own brand's GTM.
What they disliked about the product: Categorisation can be tricky – there's a sense in which much larger organisations see the benefit of their impact in other areas of business reflected in use cases where they have only minimal (if any notable) presence.

Review title: Great Customer Support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 has increased our visibility in Google search results.
We've received helpful feedback from customers.
We're using positive reviews in our marketing content.
The customer success team is always eager to ensure we're getting the most out of G2.
What they disliked about the product: The support team can be slow to respond, and sometimes we have received no response. Our relationship managers are the best way to get something addressed or actioned.
Our category does not currently meet the criteria to be included in reports, and it feels like we are missing out on some of the benefits because of this.

Review title: G2 Helps us elevate the sales profession!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The clear backend, the helpful customer success team, and ofc the ability to reach a broader market.

Review title: Very nice team and motivation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Love the team, the support and the spirit. Always helpful and trying to inspire momentum in your business.
What they disliked about the product: the pricing. Very pricy if you don't know what to do with all the data or you' re lacking capacity.

Review title: Amazing CS team, wonderful product!

What they liked about the product: Our personal CS team (Shoutout to Akshat, Will and Mark) helps us get the most out of G2 and our review campaigns. Super quick response time and always sharing new ideas.

G2 plays an essential role in the customer feedback loop.
What they disliked about the product: None for me, looking forward to working together in future projects

Review title: Great people, imperfect system
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The largest software review platform, user-friendly, and widely represented in search engines. Great guys - our Customer Success managers, quickly answer all questions. Cool badge system for reviews.
What they disliked about the product: Extremely clumsy product ranking system for non-review metrics. Half of the data is incorrect, and half of the data is out of date. Requests to update do nothing. It seems that most specialists do not understand how it works.
An extremely annoying robot assistant in the vendor's account pops up every time even though I forbid it every time.

Review title: The best review platform for IT services!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: They have great employees (Charlie and Michael) who have good ideas for collecting more reviews, and these guys are very friendly. They are always doing their best to help us stay on top. We use our badges and ranking to show prospects that our customers love us. It's a great way to build trust.
What they disliked about the product: Not all (external) metrics chosen by G2 for the Market Presence Scoring are 100% accurate.

Review title: Amazing working with G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: - The CS team is very supportive, approachable, and very proactive
- Overall good analytics to compare your performance with other competitors
What they disliked about the product: Maybe it would be better to have more transparency on how the overall marketing presence score is calculated as it does not always show the true picture

Review title: G2 is helping us a lot for collecting authetic customer reviews
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Being able to run review campaigns with incentives through G2 is the point that I like the most. Other than that, the detailed statistics on how your product ranks on G2 are a good plus.
What they disliked about the product: You can not see the rejected reviews' content which results in no possibility to object to the decision of the moderation team. I think G2 should be more transparent with the companies about this.

Review title: Helpful to gather customer references in one place
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: - Great way to centralize reviews from your customers and use referrals as a powerful lever to convert prospects in customers.
- The release of four reports a year to create communication/marketing moments
- Ability to aggregate reviews by industry, company size or geo
What they disliked about the product: Categories are maybe too broad so many times your product is displayed alongside players that are offering a totally different service. So it would be great to refine the categories.

Review title: Key Marketing Resource - Lead Gen, MOPS, and more
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: In Demand Generation, I use G2 both as a lead generation strategy but also as a tool for myself to vet new vendors.
What they disliked about the product: I would love more lead generation opportunities within the platform.

Review title: Good platform concept, poorly delivered!
Rating: 2.0
What they liked about the product: The reviews are helpful feedback on the perceived strengths and weaknesses of our product. Any issues can be fed back to the product team.
What they disliked about the product: Where do I start? Buyer intent data basically non-existent, which we hoped would play a big part in our lead generation strategy. No visibility on who visits your profile. Links are continually being met by 404 and 500 server errors which became highly frustrating when using the site daily. Customer Success team doing the bare minimum to help resolve issues.

Review title: Wonderful Customer Success Team wil make sure you get the most out of your G2 Platform
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: It really is quite easy to use once you actually try using the backend stuff. I like that you have a deditcated succes Team who will assist yo at any time.
What they disliked about the product: Its very anoying that you have to upload a screendump of having logged in to whatever platform you are reviewing in order to place a review

Review title: Robust and trustworthy review platform
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Reading and receiving reviews from real users, surfacing the pros and cons they've experienced with the products they've used, allowing you to make smarter decisions and tweak your own product.
What they disliked about the product: Missing the level of experience the reviewer has in general and with the specific reviewed product in particular. These should be factored into the general score of the reviewed product.

Review title: Ultimate marketing partner for our business
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: easy to manage and the team is incredibly responsive
What they disliked about the product: not having the possibility to list products in all supported categories

Review title: Great platform for Software business
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is a very trustworthy website from both the company and customer sides. All the reviews, reports and grids have strict rules. That's why you know that competition is fair and every tool in a high position is great.
What they disliked about the product: I would think of the value of the discussions section. From the vendor's perspective, you have to check if there are no new questions constantly. Also, sometimes the categories don't match the software ideally (tools in the category are not competitors and have just one overlapping feature).

Review title: Great at positioning your product in a category
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: It helps you understand what categories are out there, how you can position your product. It allows you to have additional insights from your customers in a trusted platform, and sometimes, those reviews are pure gold. Having a good profile and good reviews will also help your sales team with prospects. Having CRM integrations and webhooks make your life so much easier.
What they disliked about the product: Many useful features are only available in paid packages, and those are costly for firms in Central Europe. Sometimes, they overpromise the usefulness of the feature.

Review title: Great guidance and quick replies!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: During my contact and work with G2, I have really appreciated their swift help with all of my questions. As I had no experience with review strategy etc. as it is not something I usually work with in my area, it is great to be guided thoroughly! It is also great to receive concrete examples during my calls with Edan who is our contact person at G2 :)
What they disliked about the product: It has been a bit hard for us to incentivize reviews of our solution as many customers find it difficult to access via the log in that some find a bit too complicated.

Review title: Well-recognized review platform
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 badges are well-recognized, so it's nice to use them in our communication.
What they disliked about the product: I cannot really think of any right now :)

Review title: The only SaaS review platform you need
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is pretty much the go-to name for SaaS reviews. We see genuine ROI from our annual subscription fee, proven by leads referred from G2's website. In the past, the G2 team has been helpful in talking with us about product categorization to make sure we're reflected properly according to the services we offer. OUr G2 reps have always been available to help out and resolve any queries we have.
What they disliked about the product: There's not really much to dislike. We don't use a lot of the additional features so I can't comment on those too much. There are a few aspects of the UI which could be clearer, but I'm just being picky.

Review title: Simply the best tool for SaaS business
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is an excellent platform that allows us to collect authentic reviews and increase credibility with prospects. You get access to many useful lead-nurturing tools and their famous quarterly grid reports, which can be integrated strategically across all marketing content. We've deployed a couple of successful review campaigns via G2, and they've been excellent at guiding us through the process. 

The customer support team is fantastic. Mark and Henry bring many ideas to every meeting and show us how to make the most of the platform. Always positive and quick to respond!
What they disliked about the product: So far there's not much I dislike about it. Occasionally, a review takes longer to approve. It's also tricky to find out who left a review if it's marked anonymous even if we invited specific customers to leave a review for us.

Review title: G2 Review for G2 on G2
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 team was always helpful. They are responding to all the questions and are really interested in the success of the review gathering. Also platform itself is intuitive.
What they disliked about the product: A lot of reviews are being rejected, often for vague reasons. After reconsideration by the G2 team, they are getting approved. So there are a lot of mistakes in review approval procesess.

Review title: International review platform with great support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: What we like best is the international visibility provided by the platform. Being on G2 really helps us increase our product's visibility on several markets and bring customer proof to convince our prospects. The support team is also very reactive, always available and super helpful.
What they disliked about the product: It would be great to be able to access the tracking links results directly in the platform

Review title: An essential part within our marketing & growth strategy
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 offers one of the most advanced backends and UX within the market of software review platforms. The platforms gives us tangible insights about our prospects while also providing competitor analysis and feedback for our product teams.
What they disliked about the product: Certain capabilities demand either getting back to the corresponding CSM or take longer than they should in comparison to other tools. E.g. as campaign set-up or charging your account to incentivize reviews.

Review title: Great Affiliate Marketing Tool, Questionable Ranking Methodology
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: G2 has a very strong and well-established name within the SaaS 'affiliate' space and therefore has become a synonymous place for potential clients to research software solutions and explore comparisons between alternates. The backend CMS is well defined and offers great tools to track and monitor prospects from both an ABM and brand point of view. They also provide the all-important "gamification" or g2 badges that have become a representation of trust in the greater market.
What they disliked about the product: It's not one size fits all, and even though the g2 matrix has been developed in such a way that no matter where you are in the grid it is viewed as a 'positive' however this is not the case externally as all SaaS services would like to be in the leader quadrant if not the no. 1 spot. The challenge is that if your SaaS service is a niche product offering or a service that is expertise focused it can be extremely difficult to maintain and climb this 'ladder' effectively especially when past reviews are discounted negatively, despite the users and companies still actively using one's product.

Review title: A great way differentiate and get market insights
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The most powerful thing is the high number and quality of customer reviews about any B2B Software in the market. Also, it's great to sort the reviews by different filters. And finally, getting reports with quantitative information complements the qualitative info you get from reviews.
What they disliked about the product: The User Interface can be hard to navigate. There are many tabs and it can be hard to remember just exactly what you need to click to find that report had opened the other day.

Review title: Great marketing & sales tool with amazing support team!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The tool helps you with brand credibility through the badges and discovers improvements in our product.
My CSM and RM have worked hard to help us drive our brand to the top.
What they disliked about the product: - Unclear algorithm on Market Presence
- No industry filter when it comes to category ranking

Review title: The place to be to validate your brand!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It provides even the smallest SaaS companies with the validation they need to attract new leads, track competitors and minimise churn.
What they disliked about the product: Even the entry package is quite pricey, there is no real start-up offering.

Review title: Best place for collecting customer feedback and best support ever
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like using the G2 platform because the panel is sleek and smart to navigate; I can easily find all the grids, statistics and new reviews to check. Gathering customer feedback is crucial, and with G2, it's fast and efficient. Whenever I need support and ask CSM Michael Lydon or RM Charlie Albuery for help, I'm impressed by how they fast respond and listen to all my requests. I think they truly know that it is all about relationship and support.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to complain about for now. Everything looks clear to me from the implementation til now.

Review title: G2 marketing solutions are awesome
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Product profiling, reviews, the amount of due diligence in authenticating user feedback, and how G2 researches products and publishes reports using state of the art algorithm. G2 got a fantastic team and is very responsive and helpful.
What they disliked about the product: No dislike as such. However, if you provide billing in country-specific currencies in the future, that would be great.

Review title: A great way to gain trust and recognition for SaaS companies
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The best thing about G2 is the trust they have built with their own audience. When leads discover our service on G2, we can tell there is more going on than mere product/feature comparison. Unlike similar services, G2 is clearly regarded as a trusted advisor and an authority when it comes to researching software.
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing I particularly dislike about G2

Review title: it's a great platform and Customer Success Manager is great !

Review title: We love working with G2!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The best part of working with G2 is having a dedicated team to meet with every month. They always have helpful insights and tips to share to help us optimize our profile and drive more traffic to our product page.
What they disliked about the product: Getting recognized on G2 as a small company can be difficult. There's a big emphasis on the number of new reviews per quarter, and you have to reach a certain amount to be included in their reports.

Review title: Reliable support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Unique ideas for generating reviews with plenty of examples and research to back them up.
What they disliked about the product: Probably don't need so many check-ins with the account reps. I know they're just doing their jobs, but it can seem unnecessary at times.

Review title: Great experience working with G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 gives me insightful data about our customers and competition and helps us develop our marketing and sales strategies. It also increases our visibility. Working with our customer success managers Mark Landey and Henry Dann is a pleasure, they are very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.
What they disliked about the product: There's nothing that I do not dislike...

Review title: G2 provides actionable intent data for our sales team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The intent and buyer alerts around competition are amazing , our sales team jumps on these and begins messaging around this intent data and get amazing responses.
What they disliked about the product: so far nothing hasn't worked that we have implemented, our customer support team is full of great advice and best practices

Review title: Great for building consumer trust
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I like that G2 helps our brand to build consumer trust. Our relationship has been well taken care of by Will and Swati who continue to support our efforts as much as they can.
What they disliked about the product: It's been difficult to track exactly how much G2 influences our deals but the data we do have to see who visit our G2 profile has been very helpful for how we react to hot leads.

Review title: The Tripadvisor of Software
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Is a great way to collect honest and unbias reviews of your product and service. You learn so much reading what your customers say about your product here.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes could be easier to go over the review form for the people reviewing it, but overall is a great tool.

Review title: Amazing customer success team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: An nice tool for SaaS marketing! We display our verified reviews and awards on our website and marketing activities. The CSM team has been extremely helpful and responsive in supporting us with new ways to promote our brand and achievements, review campaigns, new category listings and any of our questions. So thank you, Mark, Henry and Matt, for helping us become a leader in our category!
What they disliked about the product: 1. The way the market presence score is calculated. You can work and work and work on reviews, but if a competitor has worse reviews and better alexa score, they are going to be higher in the list.
2. We cannot find the value of buyer intent. Results seem too generic for the cost of this.

Review title: An amazing review partner!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love their fantastic account management support team. They patiently answer all my questions, send me tons of resources and provide brainstorming and strategy support.
What they disliked about the product: The online site has a ton of helpful information, but the menu navigation names and sub-menus are not always the easiest to navigate. I log in often, and sometimes, it still takes a bit to remember where to go to find exactly what I need.

Review title: Professional and user-friendly
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Gain visibility and authentic reviews from people who've used the software
What they disliked about the product: Some stakeholders do not know about the platform and can be hesitant to share reviews

Review title: G2 delivers valuable insights, backed by an excellent Customer Success Team
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 gives us a great platform to receive user feedback on our services, in the relevant categories, helping us to see how they stack up against competitors. The process is user friendly and gives us a great opportunity to respond to, and act on the feedback. The review moderation process is thorough, and integral to the credibility of the reviews, badges and rankings earned.

The Customer Success Team is awesome - always responsive and helpful. They provide great advice on better ways to use the platform, as well as the insights gained from the report data.
What they disliked about the product: The layout and structure of the information in the Admin section could be improved, for better clarity and quicker access.

Review title: G2 does bring us leads and sales. More than any other software marketplace.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We've been with G2 for a long time. First, on a free plan, which was bringing us leads. Now we're on a paid plan, which brings even more. Support is also great.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike really. Well, maybe one thing: review campaigns with a gift card bonus from G2 didn't work for us that good.

Review title: Great Intent Data & Product Review Platform!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 makes it easy to capture reviews from our customers, which gives our company and products more credibility and helps us gain new leads. We always look forward to showcasing our new G2 badges every season. It also gives us valuable intent data on which companies are looking at our product categories and competitors, which helps our Sales team know where to spend their time, especially with the information being pushed into our CRM. The G2 team has also been a great partner in ensuring we always get the most out of their platform.
What they disliked about the product: No significant complaints overall - the tool is straightforward to use. There are some limitations with what information can be pushed to other platforms like HubSpot, but I know some improvements are in the works.

Review title: G2 SaaS user review
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: The support staff was fantastic and I like the layout of the reviews
What they disliked about the product: We rarely got a qualified lead from G2. We had stellar reviews but whatever traffic came to our profile, didn't convert

Review title: Great support team
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The support team - Jade and Nathan are always on hand whenever we have questions. They help us to get the best out of the platform and maximise the data we get from G2 as much as possible.
What they disliked about the product: Honestly, nothing springs to mind..........

Review title: Great booster for any company's marketing efforts!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Ease of use, variety and richness of the tools available. We use incentivized reviews quite a lot, it has allowed us to drive more potential leads and generate awareness about our product.
What they disliked about the product: I wouldn't say there are any significant downsides - perhaps, we are using just a fraction of the tools available to us heavily, but that's more of a problem on our end rather than the tools being confusing or way too complicated.

Review title: Reinforces our Brand credibility in the market!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The platform is intuitive & features are powerful. The ability to collect authentic customer reviews resulting in the quarterly reports and badges further reinforces our credibility and product offering
Our customer support team is fantastic.
What they disliked about the product: How other business rank in catagories when there is not always a great match (comparison is not always apples with apples) which skews the ranking

Review title: A great destination to help business decision-making
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love that I can find and assess software when narrowing down options. It is also great to read reviews form industry peers and that helps and streamline decision making processes.
What they disliked about the product: I would love to see some Geo-based filtering to see if services availability across locations and pricing conversion.

Review title: Amazing support for customer review campaigns!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We absolutely love working with G2 to boost reviews from our customers. They've supported us with campaign ideas, marketing collateral, analytics, and regular check-ins.
What they disliked about the product: There isn't something we particularly dislike, but we would appreciate a better definition or more specific criteria regarding our category. We sometimes see competitors who may not exactly fit in our category, and that can impact analytics and positioning in the G2 reports.

Review title: Great way to get relevant leads and position your software in the market
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's great to quickly pull up some PDFs that show you vs your competitors. This makes sales enablement material creation very easy and a quick win not just for marketing but for sales too
What they disliked about the product: As with everything, it takes a bit of a learning curve to fully utilize the tools. but the team behind the scenes is great to help where they can and is always positive in their responses

Review title: Thank you G2 and Mark

What they disliked about the product: There's nothing I can pinpoint at this time that we don't like about G2.

Review title: Great tool for every aspect of a business
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is not only a great tool to vet tools for your business, but having your tool listed in G2 is fantastic in so many ways. On the one hand, it's a great bottom-funnel lead generator, and on the other hand, you can use it internally as well.  You can see how your tool stacks up against your competitors according to users, you can analyze what your users find the most beneficial in their own words, and you can also use it to research what features are missing or need improvement. Great for marketing and product.
What they disliked about the product: I can't think of anything I dislike at this moment.

Review title: Great Help for our Company
Rating: 5.0

Review title: G2
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a nice verbatim manifestation of customer experience. The reviews can provide valuable insights.
What they disliked about the product: The process of data/contact submission can be too demanding.

Review title: Amazing Customer Service!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Excellent customer service - Siobhan and Jade are super helpful and react quickly whenever we need help! We can always count on them for support! The platform itself is intuitive and gives control to the team so that we can change a lot of things on our own.
What they disliked about the product: The only negative is the allocation of funds to landing pages - it is not super intuitive and someone might miss the fact there are no funds in a given LP.

Review title: A great way to generate user feedback
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I like the ease of getting reviews and comparing our product with those of our competitors. I also enjoy the badges we receive because they make me feel connected to our audience. And the G2 staff are open and supportive!
What they disliked about the product: Our issues aren't being resolved as quickly as we would like. The admin panel comes with bugs and problems that sometimes remain there for months at a time.

Review title: Fantastic opportunity for limitless growth
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions give limitless possibilities to grow your brand awareness and recognition in particular market your company is in. It's a great alternative to well-recognised analyst firms where your company may not be recognised as a Leader due to revenue restrictions, number of customers, etc. Here what matters are authentic customers who speak out about your brand.
What they disliked about the product: A customer review expire after 6 month period and partner reviews don't count into report releases

Review title: Best place to research and compare software
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It helps us reach new audiences through reviews. Their team has been super helpful; they helped us deploy successful review campaigns, and ultimately reach leader status in various reports.
What they disliked about the product: No downsides to Marketing Solutions, however some of our customers found the review process to be hard to understand (like the fact that they need to create an account to leave a review) and also the review questionnaire a bit long

Review title: G2 is a powerfull support to our marketing and product efforts

Buyer intent
Comparison with competition

Sometimes difficult to understand what you pay for

Review title: The team at G2 made working with them a no-brainer. An excellent solution with great support.
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 provides an all-in-one solution which is easy to understand and implement. We evaluated other review sites before choosing G2. G2 stood out regarding team response, the information provided through the sales cycle, and the fact that it is all packaged together in one solution rather than pay-to-play. This option suits us better at this point. It's also easier to implement and get going with the review collection. I can't speak highly enough of Nathan and Jade, whom I work with on the G2 side - some of the best customer support I have experienced, and it's a joy to work with them. They share helpful tips and updates, which are really appreciated. That's what builds loyalty, and importantly they also deliver results!
What they disliked about the product: I have been using G2 for an entire quarter, and thus far, I am delighted with the solution and the team support. We are in the early stages of building our review strategy, but we already have seen plenty of reasons to continue building the relationship with G2.

Review title: A precious service for customer marketing activities
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Handy analytics and features to wrap up your most relevant reviews in collections that are relevant for specific types of personas.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes the personal dashboards' UX is not very intuitive, but it doesn't take much time to learn how to navigate it.

Review title: Great buyer intent data and integrations
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Since ramping up our activity on g2 we have seen a significant increase in referrals and SQLs. The ZoomINFO integration is great as it enables us to identify our ICPs for organisations engaging with us, and our competitors. Not only this, the team are amazing and go above and beyond in doing what they can to ensure we get maximum value from the channel.
What they disliked about the product: Building out workflows can take time, it would be great if g2 added another service to set these up for their clients :)

Review title: Great for creating awareness
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is really well established and a solid go-to for anyone looking to research how business software can help solve a problem.
What they disliked about the product: Intent data turned out not to be so useful for us. Our category is less well-known and have fewer visits so intent data never got satureated enough for us.

Review title: G2 for Marketing experts
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: I like the design of the badges, and the review process as well - it is trustworthy and very detailed.  The customization part is very useful and the possibilities to expose & market the best parts of your offer, and your brand in general, are growing by the day.
What they disliked about the product: It's a bit pricy considering that the lead gen options need to be more advanced.

Review title: A great customer experience
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: What I like the most about G2 
1) the back office - I can extract a lot of information myself, I have interesting insights about my review activities, competition
2) pre-written texts after the release of reports: each report has a little text that we can easily use by simply copy pasting, with the key information about our positioning.
3) Badges and grid 
4) the ease of validation for assets
What they disliked about the product: I think the only thing I dislike about G2 is that I cannot generate my own tracking links for the team. 
Everything else is great

Review title: The best Saas marketplace for B2B.

Review title: G2 Marketing Solutions is a must-have for all marketing teams
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team at G2 Marketing Solutions is really very helpful, especially Jade who is always prompt and positive with her responses. What's more, Jade always gives insightful solutions to our problems like getting more reviews. The G2 team always leverages their industry experience to guide us. They have also made great strides in customer education by launching the G2 University.
What they disliked about the product: There is nothing to dislike about G2 -- the team is really helpful and always looking to help.

Review title: Great product with lot of integrations and really good support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The best thing for me is the intent data, being able to see the companies viewing your profile or researching competitors is brilliant. What sets G2 apart from other intent platforms I've used is the integrations and the support from our CSM and AE. 

The way that G2 has integrations with Salesforce, LeanData & SalesLoft means it perfectly integrates with our tech stack, meaning we can create rigorous processes for the leads we get. We can also easily create social audiences to retarget those visitors, removing the manual work is a real game changer for the data we see come in. 

The support we get is also far above what I've experienced before, the team always brings ideas to our monthly calls to help us get the most from the tool.
What they disliked about the product: I want more ways to segment the data in buyer intent signals/notifications. Having tags for things like B2B & B2C would be a positive move in segmenting the data.

Review title: Excellent Success Management for businesses
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: They have excellent Relationships and Success Managers. They are super responsive and persistent in solving your issues. You can feel personalized attention from them.
What they disliked about the product: I can't mention anything significant. Maybe there are some minor UX issues within the web dashboard. But this doesn't negatively affect the outcomes.

Review title: Building social proof with G2's data points
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Licensing G2's content has enabled us to provide trusted and reliable social proof on our key marketing touch points. The data points that are currently available are quite detailed and highly relevant to potential customers.
We've been working with G2 for over three years, and the customer success team has been not only dedicated to our success but proactive and open to feedback.
What they disliked about the product: - I'd like to see the algorithm used in the grid reports (specifically market presence) reviewed to better reflect what's happening in the market.
- Adding even more data points to reports would be a great value-add.

Review title: Great solution and great team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions helps potential prospects to learn more about your tool. As a user, it is also a great tool to find software and identify its benefits/weaknesses quickly.
The G2 team is always willing to help and give us some more insights on the different tools available to us.
What they disliked about the product: If a user creates a new review, the old one will be erased automatically (I would prefer the tool to ask us to choose between the 2 reviews).

Review title: Great tool for unveiling parts of your dark funnel
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I really like G2s intent data, where I can track what companies are reviewing our space (Customer Success), our peers and competitors and us specifically. Great insights and quite actionable for our sales teams. Also helps having to stellar CSMs supporting you every step of the way (Mark and Henry).
What they disliked about the product: We are very happy with the way G2 is working for us.

Review title: Powerful B2B social proof tool
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I work in marketing and G2 is extremely helpful in gathering reviews that can be repurposed as social proof elsewhere on our website and social media. I particularly like the badges, reports, and grid, which directly compare our company with competitors.
What they disliked about the product: I have nothing against G2 as such. Everything's working well.

Review title: Good support & communication
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The reports at the end of each season which give you a good overview of how you are doing versus your competitors.
What they disliked about the product: I've heard from clients that there are a bit too much requirements to write a review. Maybe you could change this or change the way that you ask questions.

Review title: Great customer support
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The level of support and attention to detail from our customer success reps during our campaign
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to note so far. We've only been working with G2 for a relatively short amount of time but so far it's been a very good experience.

What they liked about the product: Everything in G2 is easy to use and it's easy to reach the team when needed.
What they disliked about the product: I can't really think of anything, a solid platform all round.

Review title: The best way to get feedback (and social proof)
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to capture customer feedback and turn it into powerful social proof. G2 is where I learn more about software products, and as a marketer, I can't afford not to be leveraging the power of G2 for our company. The team does an excellent job of positioning G2 as the market leader and attracting, educating and inspiring millions of "software shoppers".
What they disliked about the product: The time it takes for a review to be moderated can be weeks (lately).

Review title: A surprisingly powerful platform for user advocacy and competitive analysis
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Our Customer Success Managers are always friendly and helpful, and help us to make the most of the software and services that are available to us through the platform.
What they disliked about the product: The scope of the platform is surprisingly powerful, but the tools that it provides aren't yet integrated, which means that the information is currently siloed in different areas of the platform.

Review title: G2 played a key role in our GTM
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: The review program is well thought and the possibility to share reviews in various marketing channels is great. Customer success has been really helpful at G2 - special thanks for Mark.
What they disliked about the product: Complete lack of success metrics on whether G2 has helped us.

Review title: A Reliable tool for customers
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: An easy platform that enables getting reliable feedback from customers.
What they disliked about the product: Gathering reviews every quarter (3 months) is sometimes exhausting. Reducing the frequency is needed.

Review title: Great product, great support!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The easy to use interface. The G2 badges are great for marketing
What they disliked about the product: The cost, it's quite expensive. The buyer intent data is US focused

Review title: G2 is the #1 review platform
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 will help set up notifications for our sales teams based on intent of users researching our categories. It also runs review emails which is one less thing our customer marketing team needs to do.
What they disliked about the product: The G2 score allows for ties, so there can be multiple 1st place positions. This makes it difficult to create a marketing strategy around.

Review title: Great for buyer intent and industry rankings
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The buyer intent is definitely the most important part for us, and access to marketing assets such as badges and industry grids.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing really. The business plans and prices can be a bit complex in the beginning, but the customer success team is great at explaining and follow up

Review title: Much higher ROI compared to Analyst Relations
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: After the first few reviews, we started to receive valuable marketing materials. We used them heavily on Social, especially LinkedIn and could gain significant engagement from our target group. I particularly like how G2 staff is engaging with such social content, which helps spread the word even further. 

We decided to use G2 instead of building expensive analyst relationships, which paid off very quickly, especially if one has a solid social team that creatively utilises content.
What they disliked about the product: I find the user interface quite complicated, and I am constantly searching for where to find things. So the front-end is excellent, but the back-end needs improvement.

What they liked about the product: Easy-to-use marketing solution tool with great customer support.
What they disliked about the product: More transparency and categories can be helpful.

Review title: One of the best ways to increase your brand reputation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: There is no doubt that G2 is the most familiar software review platform. Our social proof on all marketing assets is greatly enhanced by the G2 seasonal reports with all of their badges you can earn and claim. 
Their dashboard is simple, and their account managers are some of the best I've encountered. And above all, we really learn a lot from all the reviews.
What they disliked about the product: Setting up the review invitations campaign requires CSV files with customer lists that I must prepare in advance.
The price for the content package is a bit high for my company's needs.

Review title: Great experience so far
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Good and fast communication, always helpful.
What they disliked about the product: Not really have anything negative so far.

Review title: Excellent services & team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Easy to use and collaborate on internally. We are able to see how our competitors are performing and measure ourselves against the competition.
Its great to see the progress on dashboards and track review activity
What they disliked about the product: Not fully understanding why some of our reviews are rejected and how we could better inform our customers.
But apart from that, there is little else I could fault about the platform

Review title: Great addition to your brand credibility
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 team is very helpful and is motivated to help generate more reviews for our business page. The review campaigns are a great way to generate new reviews from customers. The platform is easy to navigate.
What they disliked about the product: Other than the profile page, there are not other ways that are available to help educate G2's audience on our company

Review title: G2 is providing a set of tolls that provide value to the business bottom line
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to tailor a package to match our business strategy
What they disliked about the product: There is quite a bit of overhead in managing and running all the programs and profiles

Review title: Really useful features for building social proof
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: It's been really worthwhile in gathering reviews from users and getting access to data on companies who are searching for a platform like ours.
What they disliked about the product: So far, I don't have any complaints. Mark and Henry have been really helpful and thorough in helping us get to grips with the features and make the most out of them.

Review title: G2 are helping us to build social proof, reduce churn and strengthen business cases!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The reporting of our review performance against our competitors helps us to get a better understanding of our market positioning.
The feedback we receive from customers helps us to improve our product roadmap, so we can better serve our client base and develop our software.
Our Account Manager, Siobhan, is so responsive and helpful! She is also a joy to meet with and always brings energy and new ideas to our monthly check-ins.
What they disliked about the product: We initially had some teething issues with being notified when budgets ran out, which was quickly actioned by our AM.
It can be hard to track leads that come from G2. Sometimes the buyer intent isn't directly indicative of in-market opportunities.

Review title: Great support and service from our Relationship Manager!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I appreciate to receive fast feedback each time I've a question. I always get great support whenever I'm in need. Our Relationship Manager is a true problem solver.
What they disliked about the product: I don't have the time to discover all the great things you can do with G2.

Review title: Great for trust-building
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 delivers third-party, peer reviews for software solutions in a process-driven way that is both helpful and convenient. As G2 handles the reviews entirely, customers can be sure these are independent and tamper-free -- this in turn helps vendors build trust, by showing prospects what customers truly think of the brand and its offerings. The platform also serves as a window into a company's solutions, by enabling vendors to set up and update product pages with ease. The Account Manager team to assist vendors are helpful and friendly.
What they disliked about the product: The process for end customers to submit a review is a bit lengthy and can be offputting. The contract side of things can be more complex than it needs to be; it could also benefit from being more flexible.

Review title: Great Collaboration
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Always helpful with questions & insanely good initiative, which definitely helps us move forward
What they disliked about the product: That I often do not have enough time. Sorry for that! Still so happy to have you!

Review title: Trusted reviews for SAAS
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 as a platform is really easy to use and gives you lots of valuable insights.  As a business, it's really great that reviews are verified so other users know they can be trusted and they're not being faked. The badges that you can earn from each report are also great for marketing.

Have to say our account manager Siobhan is also excellent. Over the two years we've worked together, she's always been there to offer advice and support, plus, it's been lovely to have a catch-up when you've been working together for a while! She has gone the extra mile for us and done things like present to our business on the importance of reviews and different ways we can run review campaigns.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing. Only wish I had some more time on my end to make the most of G2!

Review title: Tailored and supportive service
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The quality of the service is excellent. We got a lot of support from Siobhan on improving our product page and which parts to focus on. It really felt like an extension of the team, focused on delivering our results, rather than a sales-focused relationship.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing comes to mind; the service is flexible to fit our needs.

Review title: No-brainer social proof for any B2B SaaS vendor
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: As a B2B SaaS marketing veteran, I know how crucial it is to provide prospects with social proof. So I knew I had to get my G2 game up to speed when I started heading the marketing. I'm happy to say G2's team helped me set up my page very quickly and helped me get an initial number of reviews to put my startup on the map. We even won 9 G2 badges just about 3 months after starting.
What they disliked about the product: G2 is a must-have for every SaaS that wants to make a real name for itself, and I'm stressing that even though it isn't cheap, it's still worth the investment.

Review title: Took our Market presence to whole new level
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 has been the platform to showcase our customers' trust in the public's eye. We have been getting more leads and Visitors to our site through G2. The new users feel confident about our product following the reviews on G2. Our CSM @Arijit_Das has been very helpful and supportive in every aspect. A special thanks to him!
What they disliked about the product: It would be great to extract more data with our current plan.

Review title: Great platform to source quality leads!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 platform is incredibly helpful in finding quality leads. The setup is very easy and self-explanatory, and my account manager Siobhan is the absolute best! She's helped me gain over 100 reviews for 2 different companies I've worked for thus far. G2 gives you the opportunity to showcase your company's value propositions and bring in quality leads.
What they disliked about the product: There isn't anything that I particularly dislike about the G2 platform. The only thing I'd say is that I wish we had some more insight into the buyer intent feature, but that is an add-on with extra costs associated.

Review title: Really enjoyed working with G2
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The team are very knowledgeable and always contactable - always on hand with ideas to help build the reviews to help with the business

Review title: Great platform and fantastic customer support team
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Onboarding was super smooth, and we've made a good start with reviews on the platform. The grids are helpful to see how we compare to competitors, and we enjoy using the badges too. It's an excellent way for us to build brand awareness and credibility. 

Mark and Henry are great! At every catch-up meeting, they come with new ideas and examples of how we can gather more reviews and use all of the features.
What they disliked about the product: There isn't anything we dislike. We'd love to use G2 intent data in Zoominfo but sadly that requires a package upgrade

Review title: Really easy to use and great support from the team
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The platform is really easy to use, and you get so much information from it - including which companies have looked at your page! The team at G2 are also really helpful and give you loads of great advice for getting the most from the site.
What they disliked about the product: While having each review checked makes the site more respected (and, hey, that's why it's so great), it does mean it's pretty hard to get people to fill out reviews.

Review title: Amazing product and support, G2 is crucial for our international expansion!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I really like that you can promote your company, our offers, and the support. Wow! Amazing! Answers all our questions super fast! :)
What they disliked about the product: Nothing, some small improvements can be done in the admin site but isn't that a challenge for every SaaS company out there. ;D

Review title: Report badges are brilliant for our reputation and social proof!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The review generation campaigns have been great for boosting our rankings in relevant categories. We weren't on any grids just over a year ago, and now we're featured in 6.

The team are great and super helpful to work with as well.
What they disliked about the product: We wish we could do more with the buyer intent data. The salesforce integration didn't work for us.

Review title: The best investment of money and excellent customer service!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I really like G2's customer service. All G2 managers I ever worked with were very supportive and fully invested in improving the performance of our advertising package.

Review title: G2 provides hugely valuable insights to our customers that are ultimately driving adoption of Willo
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It's simple to use, the team are great and we get unbelievable value from seeing our customer reviews.
What they disliked about the product: Sometimes the reviews aren't accurate. It is reassuringly hard to get them removed!

Review title: G2 is a great platform to collect reviews! Our CSM is great!!!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 becomes a best practice WW. Customers know the platform and understand the importance of sharing reviews. Having great reviews helps our Sales process and improve our service.
What they disliked about the product: If a user does not mention his name while sharing a bad review, you can send a notification, but you won't know the reviewer. In order to improve ourselves, we prefer to reach out to the reviewer directly and have a clear plan with him. In case we know the reviewer, it is straightforward for us to contact and apply a quick mitigation plan.
You can't generate the personal link and follow the incoming reviews per CSM.
For this, we have a great CSM, Jatin Chaudhari, that is doing a great job setting up the scheduled reports.

Review title: Fantastic Partner!
Rating: 5.0

What they disliked about the product: nothing so far, everything with G2 is fantastic

Review title: Very helpful team, friendly and professional
Rating: 3.0
What they liked about the product: The team provides valuable insights and suggestions on how to gain new reviews. They always support their pitches with statistics and solid data analysis.
What they disliked about the product: I find the deadlines between the G2 awards very tight. It's hard for small and medium businesses to set up new campaigns in short amounts of time.

Review title: Great way to hear authentic customer voice
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I like to hear how my customers are getting value from my company's product. We can use that to share with other customers, leverage in social and provide feedback to our product team.
What they disliked about the product: There's a need to recruit new 5-star customer reviews consistently or you could lose traction with competitors. This doesn't necessarily add a ton of incremental value to marketing activities.

Review title: G2 Reviews
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The insights directly from users has provided invaluable feedback for us to make decisions
What they disliked about the product: I wish there was more flexibility in how the reviews were structured

Review title: Great team and they make it easy!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions allows us to have our G2 reviews on many of the SaaS marketplaces where our company has solutions listed!

Review title: PartnerStack Staple
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is super helpful when looking up ISV's or alternative PRM solutions, the categories and directory are crucial to the way navigate different industries and drive business.
What they disliked about the product: I don't necessarily have anything that I dislike with G2, all my experiences have been positive for the most part. If I do come across any negative experiences, I'll be sure to add another review.

Review title: Best marketing platform for B2B SaaS business
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 intent is one of the things that I like in G2. We will have the visibility of companies researching about us and competitors is the one of the best features.
What they disliked about the product: I don't think it is a downside but it would be really helpful if we can get more insights on competition.

Review title: Expanding the Customer Story
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: What I like most about G2 Marketing Solutions is that it effectively allows teams to leverage their positive customer base reputation. Automation and integrations help automate the story of your business, and G2 provides much better and more detailed insight to make a decision.
What they disliked about the product: I dislike at times that some reviews get rejected and there might not be a completely clear reason as to why (although it does provide a bit of context) - so the filtering is good to an extent, but more transparency would be good in that area.

Review title: I wish there was more transparency
Rating: 1.5
What they liked about the product: The automation and simplicity of the emails to send out. I like that they have it built with triggers to remind your customers to write a review. I like that you can see how you compare to your competitors.
What they disliked about the product: There is not a lot of transparency to how things are calculated.  I would like if everything was public on how things were measured to be able to create a strategy.

Review title: G2 is the most important tool in my tech stack
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I use G2 to collect customer reviews. As a Customer Marketer, that stuff is like pure gold to me. Both from a product feedback standpoint and from a market perception standpoint, nothing is more valuable than a constant influx of customer reviews.
What they disliked about the product: I occasionally wish that there was less of a desire to game the system, which is relatively easy to do with G2. Sometimes I feel like our position on the grid and within G2's algorithm isn't a true representation of our market share and perception, and that can be frustrating to overcome. That said, the algorithm is what it is, and it's all about maximizing the potential of your profile.

Review title: Great for visibility growth
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: Using G2 has been great for getting us more visibility and seeing the buyer intent data. There are a lot of widgets and tools within G2 that have been great. Some we have yet to explore but so far the experience has been positive.
What they disliked about the product: It was a bit difficult getting the buyer intent data integrations up and running but our support team have helped walk us through our questions and get everything ready to go. They've been very supportive and responsive in regards to that. I also dislike that we cannot customize the campaign emails coming from G2 but have been finding creative ways around sending campaigns on our end. We are a global company and have difficulty with having customers outside of the US trust the site but the more visibility we get the better results we see.

Review title: Excellent service
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Find new software as well promote your own software with real reviews.
What they disliked about the product: There are still a few bugs in the admin-ui

Review title: G2 is a great framework
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Working with G2 has a lot of big benefits: 

- They help my team to think, in a more targeted way, about how we're represented in the world. 

- They give us the tools to share our product with a wider audience. 

- They provide a structure for generating feedback in a repeatable way. 

- They generate insight into the browsing patterns of our leads and how our competitors are presenting themselves.

- We've also maintained a very solid relationship with the team at G2 throughout the purchase and onboarding process with Jordan, Will and Akshat. They don't let us rest on our laurels and keep us motivated to do the work and get full value from the platform.
What they disliked about the product: There's nothing in our relationship with G2 that I would describe as unhelpful or counter-productive. It's fair to say that we had to invest some time adapting standardized G2 processes to our business, given specifics like our deal sizes, sales cycle, internal capacity etc. but they always met us in the middle with this.

Review title: pure explanation
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: prospect tracking, web hooks, buyer intent
What they disliked about the product: based on company base we are able to target people on linkedin not on individual base

Review title: Good to get knowledgeable on all the products
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Best to use this product in this market because no other company like G2 had these many products and features to get addressed hear along with practical documentation
What they disliked about the product: Nothing much but only the portal dashboards were little slow in loading becaus of the other pages would recommend G2 to get better graphical pages along with all the required designs

Review title: Great team and great product
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a great platform! We enjoy working with the G2 team. They are extremely responsive and helpful. The platform itself is always evolving but the functions provided by G2 are awesome - for example: the review program and grid reports as well as the intent data. The integration with 6sense allows us to really see who is in market to buy allowing us to make more informed phone calls.
What they disliked about the product: Price can be pretty expensive, however, given the offerings I believe the cost makes sense.

Review title: Amazing CSM Support from Jade Cass
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Jade is very proactive in sharing best practices on how we can use G2 more effectively and joins the call with the best possible energy. It feels like having a very educational cup of coffee with a friend. Love our talks and leaving each call with new ways of improving our position definitely is great!
What they disliked about the product: So far only positive feedback! Whenever I need support i receive it and get solutions.

Review title: User friendly
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The thing that made my experience great with G2 is I am able to check and review the software that I am using. I am helping also the company to know what are the great things about their software and also the things that they need to improve
What they disliked about the product: It covers a wider range of software with a most user friendly interface and i thinks that's what one factor that I don't like because it will be possible that people might be confuse with the feedback per software and cannot come up to a decision if what's trustworthy software to use.

Review title: Very useful website
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 marketing solutions help people to choose what application they would buy by providing reviews from all users who have experience with a certain application.
What they disliked about the product: The only thing I dislike about G2 marketing solutions is the website sometimes takes me to another page without clicking on it, but overall everything is perfect.

What they liked about the product: G2 is the pinnacle in terms of effective solutions, with a unique and easy-to-use interface, it allows customers dynamic management and is attractive to users, it is a fast and effective system in terms of marketing.

The use of ABM is totally magnificent when it comes to growing in the world of technology and this G2 service allows it in an incredible way. He also defends clients with valuable ideals and gives solutions in a concrete, direct and correct way possible.

the tools that G2 presents us help to provide the best solutions for the growth of our businesses. It's the new world for customers. generating thousands and millions of interested parties but most importantly they are satisfied with their work.

Review title: UNRELIABLE INFORMATION
Rating: 0.0
What they liked about the product: It's platform makes it easy to send out reviews
What they disliked about the product: The system that rates your score doesn't make sense to the user...you can get multiple great reviews yet the score doesn't move and no one has been able to tell me what goes into the score and how it's weighted

Review title: Most trusted platform offering valuable insights and feedbacks for great softwares
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 has a thriving community of software users, experts, and professionals. Users can actively participate in discussions, ask questions, and seek advice from the community, creating a collaborative environment for knowledge sharing.

 Not to mention the trustworthy ratings and rankings based on real user reviews. This grid particularly, offers a visual representation of software products' market presence and customer satisfaction, enabling users to compare and evaluate different options within specific categories effectively.

This marketplace encourages software vendors to actively engage with users, respond to reviews, and address concerns which fosters vendor accountability and transparency, allowing potential buyers to gauge the vendor's commitment to customer satisfaction.
What they disliked about the product: I think G2 is yet to cover so many softwares available in the market which are not so known to people.

Review title: Complete business insight to make informed decision for chosing a software platform for enterprises
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Crowd is a platform that provides complete insight for making an informed decision about choosing a software platform. It facilitates the customers with an unbiased experience through trusted & verified opinions, thus leading them to choose a platform for their enterprise without any hassle.
What they disliked about the product: This platform is an all-in-one marketing solution with significantly lesser downsides. However, for reviewers, a delete option for unpublished reviews can make them more feasible for their selection.

Review title: G2 works if you use it right
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Definitely helps with customer perception. We do hear often that deals that we signed, the prospects checked us out on G2 before making the decision. G2 team is helpful.
What they disliked about the product: Maybe do the grid reports every 6 months instead of every quarter. Make it a bit more exclusive and difficult to get in to the reports.

Review title: One of the Best Marketing Platform to feature your product or service
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: It deep down shows the competitive analysis and gap areas which can give you various insights to improvise your own product or service to rank better on searches.
What they disliked about the product: The inital amount which begins with a Lakh of rupees and can't be afforded by small enterprises or new start-ups

Review title: Extensive platform with positive support experience
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We love our Relationship Manager Charlie and Customer Success Manager Rachel. Their support really helped us to get things going quickly. The 6-month and 1-year reviews were helpful to see how far we have gone and to create strategies for the coming year. The CS structure has changed a little bit; we hope that it won't affect the relationship with G2 going forward.

The platform itself is also very good, quite extensive and a lot of options. We integrate it with our HubSpot to keep track of form submissions on G2.
What they disliked about the product: The tool is super extensive, so it takes a while to really understand how things work and take advantage of all the features available. The analytics can be a bit of a mystery.

Review title: Good tool for gathering VOC
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The dashboards in G2 are very thorough and allow you to easily look at where your product ranks in it's category and against it's competitors. Buyer intent is also a useful tool.
What they disliked about the product: There are way too many badges and reports in G2.

Review title: G2 is okay
Rating: 3.0
What they liked about the product: I like that the analytics is robust to see where things are coming from.
What they disliked about the product: Review verification is not always accurate. Real reviews are being left out or rejected. There is no appeals process or way to see who the feedback is from so we are missing reviews. There should be a way for a company to verify that the reviewer is actually real.

Review title: I love G2
Rating: 3.5
What they liked about the product: I like our rep is easily accessible and responds to us quickly and helps us get more reviews from G2

Review title: Informative and Innovative Team
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I enjoy how much G2  is looking towards the future and adapting to the ever-changing world of the internet/technology. Our rep is also awesome and super knowledgeable.
What they disliked about the product: The moderation process is almost too in-depth... I find that sometimes verified reviews are rejected. The process is also lengthy and can be overall annoying compared to other review sites.

Review title: Good early traction, then fall-off
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: Great personal account support. Our rep meets with us regularly and tries to do all she can to help us get the most out of the G2 system.
What they disliked about the product: G2 itself is extremely janky. We had to write up & justify the category that we belong in because G2 didn't understand our industry. We needed to explain why we should or shouldn't be tucked up underneath other categories. We needed to explain, in long-form, why certain companies they identified as our competitors should not even *be* in the category they threw them into.

Talking with Monty, he literally could not even recognize our product category and instead provided to me pages of unrelated market segments. When I gave him the exact page in G2 that I was referring to it said "I don't have access to live G2 database but I rely on set of structured database information which I currently lack for [my company's category]."

While we had initial traction in getting reviews once we signed the contract, that dried up quickly (after 1-2 months) and then we haven't gotten *any* reviews in the past half-year.

I wish I got sentiment analytics on the page even if someone *didn't* leave a review. I wish there was a way to know how many users were "watching us" or whether they had a positive brand sentiment. I can see pageviews, but I wish I could tell if folks were "subscribed" to our brand. So we could push updated information to those who had more than passing interest.

Review title: Great Expierence with the G2 review platform and Intent Integrations
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: We first focused on review generation to enhance our company profile with G2 but have now realized how instrumental G2 is in our sales cycle. With prospects utilzing G2 to compare our company with competitors, we have been able to leverage this data to enhance our value props and differentiate ourselves from the competition. In addition to this, we are just tapping into G2 Intent and already seeing great things and are excited to see the full value of this tool.
What they disliked about the product: I have no complaints at this time. The G2 team is very responsive to any questions or concerns that we have.

Review title: A must-have for tool in the marketing tech stack
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: 1. Intent data from G2 is an essential part of our outbound strategy. Also the rich context (product and place visited, history, buying stage, etc.) and additional information provided (relevant people to reach out, Bombora intent topics, etc.) help us finetune our outbound strategy and make it more actionable 

2. Real-time Slack alerts are helpful (profile and pricing page visits)—helps us quickly action on them

3. Excellent customer experience right from onboarding to customer success. The CSM is always quick to respond even during this holiday season. He truly tries to solve problems and meet requirements—be it soliciting more reviews from our customers or maximizing our use of the platform. Also, his emails with new feature releases are very helpful and actionable
What they disliked about the product: It's been a very good experience so far. One call out is that some feature asks (e.g, more granularity in what Slack notifications are sent) took a very long time to be implemented (>9 months). This was an essential for the Slack notifications be useful for us.

Review title: G2 looks out for their costumers! They are quick to respond and very helpful.

Review title: Fantastic experience with the G2 Platform and Account Management
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The G2 platform has be instrumental securing reviews from our global customers. The platform is intututive in terms of company profile set up, reports are detailed, and the account management support that my team and I have received has been exceptional.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing comes to mind as we have had a very positive experience.

Review title: Great Tool for Reviews
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 has really great functionality and the team we work with is always quick to respond to answer our questions and teach us how to use anything they offer.
What they disliked about the product: There are quite a few features so there is still a lot of functionality for us to uncover.

Review title: Strong brand, strong partner
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 has a strong brand reputation in the software reviews space with both consumers and software providers. By leveraging them as a third-party source for quality customer feedback, we've been able to build and strengthen our own company's brand reputation.

In addition, the G2 CSMs we have had for the last few years have all been committed to partnering with us to grow and strengthen our profile and position in category. I know they're available to support us whenever we have a need.
What they disliked about the product: Due to our organizational structure and priorities we aren't able to make full use of all the G2 tools, content, and integrations available. For what we are paying in subscription fees, this can sometimes be challeging to justify as an expense.

Review title: unbiased feedback direct from customers at its best!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I LOVE the team. They are always available for questions. They also go out of their way to ensure we have the tools needed to get the most out of the platform.
What they disliked about the product: Its not really a G2 thing but I wish I could get the team to spend more time with as it really is a game changer.

Review title: Great Trust Builder
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I like the simplicity of their backend system to enhance your profile and get more reviews. It makes it easy to view stats, and grab any marketing badges you'll need. It also like the social templates it gives you.
What they disliked about the product: The market presence and G2 scoring for reporting needs to be fixed. I also think the intent audience should not be an add on but included with your esential subscription.

Review title: G2 reviews are a low lift way to fuel our MQLs
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: We set up our lead flow to sync automatically with Salesforce from G2 and were able to easily start collecting highly-qualified leads. The team at G2 is also very helpful and provides timely responses whenever we reach out and they have helped us through several team transitions and strategy changes.
What they disliked about the product: We do want to promote some of our performance but with new results coming out all the time and the landscape always changing, it is difficult for us to commit to the additional spend for a content subscription so we haven't done it so far.

Review title: Most reputable review site in the market
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2, with its extensive customer base and status as the review site attracting the most traffic, is well-equipped to address your specific needs and challenges. It simplifies the process of identifying your requirements and discovering how others are tackling issues similar to yours. Additionally, G2's grid report and award system provide us with current insights into the competitive landscape, encouraging us to continually explore new methods to engage our customer base."
What they disliked about the product: Its product-based approach poses a challenge for businesses with multiple products like ours. Our customers are familiar with our overarching brand, making it difficult for us to obtain reviews that are specific to each individual product.

Review title: Incredibly powerful marketing tool
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: This is an amazing marketing tool and our Customer Service Manager is incredibly resourceful and available to help when we need it. Always offering new ideas, helping us know what the next steps are. Once the G2 ball gets rolling, it picks up momentum really quickly!
What they disliked about the product: There are quite a few different pieces to manage with G2 and it can be quite overwhelming at first, but it all starts coming together after a while. The integrations seem to be more complicated than we initially thought, but that isn't uncommon.

Review title: Turnkey tools
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2's marketing tools can adapt to teams of all sizes. They have plenty of features to help scale the customer voice into other teams and systems (e.g. reference pages, quote library, integrations with 6sense). It is simple enough for a team of one to learn quickly, but robust enough for an entire marketing org to find value out of it. More than anything, the direct support I've received from G2 has been huge in my continuing to advocate and find value in the platform. Our Account Manager and Customer Success Manager have become valued professional peers — it really feels like I've built a rapport with them. They are patient and not pushy and bring a consultative approach to our partnership.
What they disliked about the product: For companies with a large product ecosystem, you may experience limitations with how much you can do across multiple product pages (depending on your subscription). G2 Categories don't always align 1:1 with the products we offer, which can sometimes poorly position us against other companies within the category. As more unique AI products and tools emerge, I'd love to see G2 keep pace with corresponding categories.

Review title: G2 is the best buyer review site for software
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The platform is very modern and easy to use. Lots of greaf analytics features.
What they disliked about the product: Can be expensive to get access to certain features and hard to measure ROI

Review title: Expand your Reach
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I worked previously for a SMB organization who relied on G2 and customer reviews to build their credibility and lead flow in a new business category.

Review title: Powerful Marketing/Sales Tool
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Using G2 and growing your product profile is an incredibly power tool for customer aquisiton and retention. Its easy to find endless ways to utilize the profile to by building different types of content to be used in organic and paid digital channels. Something we do all year long. Also using their buyer intent to give your sales team and account managers insight on new and current customers. The G2 staff are also genius, they help ten fold in making sure you maximize the potential of your G2 account. Its efforless to run review capturing campaigns.
What they disliked about the product: I have not found a disadvantage to using G2 after using it for 4 yrs.

Review title: Easy to use for brands to boost visibility of their software solutions to target audiences
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Its very easy for brands to build out their product profiles and generate review campaigns to boost reviews. In my opinion it is vital for software products to have a presence on the platform in order to effectively competein their product category. I like the recent feature we leveraged - adding our products to a product suite.
Our G2 reps are always responsive and helpful when we need support, and its been great that we can leverage G2 badges and testimonials in our own marketing campaigns to demonstrate legitimacy.
What they disliked about the product: It can be a challange to grow organically if your products are not already well-known, so it requires investment. IT's still important to have a presence on the platform.

Review title: Partnering with G2 helps us elevate our brand!
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Our account managers are committed to helping us achieve our goals. They are responsive and attentive to our ideas, and they are constantly working to find solutions as well as suggest new approaches. 

The vendor portal is incredibly intuitive and allows us to access the information we need whenever we are seeking it.
What they disliked about the product: The simpleness of the questions makes it easy to source higher quanitity of reviews, but the quality of feedback we receive is often less than ideal. We'd love to get more in-depth review responses from our customers.

Review title: Awesome Marketing Consultants
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love how G2 comes to us with ideas and not the other way around. They are always showing how other clients are using their content and what would best help our company succeed. I also love their webinars and other resources they promote as it's usually very applicable to my day to day. They are always very prompt in responding to our questions and concerns which is greatly appreciated! Lastly, their reputation in the review space is top notch -- they are the #1 trust platform in my opinion for prospects to go to when reviewing products like ours.
What they disliked about the product: Wish there was a way to capture additonal leads through this platform (i.e. a PPC program).

Review title: Helpful Team!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 captures a lot a traffic and generate many views on your product site. The best part is their proactiveness to help you maximize your ROI and their openess to correct situations that aren't working.
What they disliked about the product: They could have more connectors, specifically to Salesforce.

Review title: A great platform for customer evidence and social proof
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 is a valuable tool for getting your customers talking about your product on the record about what they like or dislike about your products.  G2 allows your customers to share highlights of their story of using your product in a public way and in their own words which is useful to prospective buyers evaluating your products. 

Feature enhancements and integrations are regularly made on G2 Marketing solutions that help Marketers utilize and gain value from the platform. I've also had a consistently positive experience with their Customer Success team through regular check-ins to help ensure that we are achieving value from G2 Marketing Solutions.
What they disliked about the product: There can be an over-indexing on review volume and recency and not as much of an emphasis on the quality of review, the content, or how Marketing teams are utilizing reviews which can be difficult for Marketers wearing a lot of hats. 

It's important to strike a balance of review quality and quantity, to respond to reviews, and to be disciplined in taking advantage of all that reviews have to offer Marketing teams today.

Review title: The simplest, highest quality review vendor, with the best CSM team in the game
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I've been working with G2 with my company's upgraded profile accounts for years now and each year is better than the last. Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.

The vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. 

Implementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.

Integrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. 

Review generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.

Buyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.

G2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time. Compared to other review vendors, the portal is always running well and ive experienced little to no system errors.
What they disliked about the product: I really had to think hard to find somewhere G2 falls short and the ONLY thing I've been able to come up with is some of the marketing assets in the vendor portal are only available via HTML embed code and sometimes we need them in JPEG form. But if you reach out to your CSM, they'll get that for you very quickly.

Review title: G2 is great for B2B marketing

Review title: Customer Evidence at scale
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 allows Everbridge and xMatters a way to get customer reviews and evidence at scale. We sell our products around the world and having real customer experiences helps us stay true to our mission and reach new business and organizations. We use our reviews frequently and love seeing feedback on improvements from our customers.

Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions is such an important part of our customer advocacy program. The guidance and  help from our reps are truly invaluable!

Review title: Easy to use platform with great support to help build your business
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is a great platform to showcase your product and features for potential customers to find and compare you to other similar companies.  We have been using G2 for about a year and have seen a significant increase in traffic to our G2 page, as well as click through to our website.
The support we have received from Reagan and Brittany has also been great, they have helped with strategies from building out our profile, to gathering reviews and using those reviews to drive traffic and leads.
What they disliked about the product: The only downside I have come across compared to some other platforms is that we can't run a paid lead generation campaign through G2

Review title: A helpful resource for software companies
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The G2 team is very helpful and involved! They provide reccomendations and data when needed.
What they disliked about the product: It would be nice to have more control over what questions we could ask when we are cunducting our own review outreach.

Review title: Incredibly Useful Marketing Software
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The customer support team is amazing. Once you learn all the bells and whistles, very effictive marketing tool, especiall the review campaigns that G2 can run on your behalf.
What they disliked about the product: It can be overwhelming to learn all the features and to use the utizile them correctly.

Review title: Lots of options

Review title: Essential Tool for Building Trust in our Buying Process
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The ability to launch review campaigns with ease, as well as to create customized landing pages and utilize widgets in our email marketing and website are very helpful in establishing ourselves as a market leader in our category. The G2 platform is intuitive, and the team is always willing to help make sure we are getting the most from our investment. The Chilipiper integration has also been a helpful tool to get new leads into our system quickly.
What they disliked about the product: The only downside we experience with G2 is that there are not as many of our competitors that use it, so our category is not robust enough yet to have a report created, which would be a great marketing piece for us.

Review title: G2 Takes Work off my Hands
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: For me the value G2 adds is having Greg from their team be our consultant. Ultimatelly his ability to understand our product and pitch ideas for campaigns is where the value is for us. Obviously, there is a lot that the platform does to help drive people researching CAD products to our site. But ultimatelly its the consulting service that makes a big difference on why I enjoy using the tool, it's a partnership for success.
What they disliked about the product: My biggest concern is that the leads we are sourcing are not converting at the rate that we would like them to convert, and that is a pity. But we have seen better performance since we modulated our strategy, so I do hope that the trend will stay possitive.

Review title: intent signals for LinkedIn for paid ad audience development plus Slack integration
Rating: 3.0
What they liked about the product: Integrations with tools we already use; intent signals against poor reviews for competitors
What they disliked about the product: Not enough granularity to weed out the mostly junk signals we get; i.e "property managetemnt' software when we need "commercial property management'

Review title: Lots of opportunities to benefit from reviews!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: What I like best are the various ways to promote ones reviews. Reference pages, testimonials, widgets, etc. Getting reviews seen beyond the G2 site as well as on it is what turns the dial.
What they disliked about the product: Because it's a robust platform, there are many features and it can take a while to learn to navigate quickly and easily.

Review title: Great tool for customer insights
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The simplicity of capturing customer reviews and VOC insisght is highly valuable, as our customers have many competing prioroties in their day. The interface and UX is simple on both ends - for reviewers and account admins. G2 offers robust analytics from review campaign data to buyer intent, and I appreciate the  ability to input custom questions to gather additional decision-making data from our customers.
What they disliked about the product: The review approval process is a bit rigid. I'd appreciate the ability to review/approve/dispute reviews on our end, like we have with some other peer insight platforms.

Review title: Easy way to ask your customers what they think
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Good support and suggestions to boost our visibility from our Account Manager. Admin portal is easy to use and shows some useful data.
What they disliked about the product: Not easy to see all companies who feature in a higher position than us in the category league tables in the portal unless we're 5th or higher (eg where we're ranked 8th, I can see the top 4 ranked companies followed by us, but not who's 5th-7th)

Review title: Great platform to get in depth user and market insights
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: I like how easy and intuitive is the platform to use. You can list your product and create an in depth profile, collect references and leads. The review generation capabilities are great and G2 provides various channels to do so. The CSM's and account owners are always propmt to respond to anything. The reports generation and badges let you understand the competitive market and tweak your offereings based on it. Highly recommend!
What they disliked about the product: The reviews generation sometimes maybe not very genuine. Its is all about quantity and less about quality and in between that the authenticity of the review is sometimes lost.

Review title: Great experience and service with G2 Marketing Solutions
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: As someone that inherited a G2 profile, the G2 team were excellent in getting me up to speed and offering solutions for a newbie like me. The platform is easy to use, but has all the data and features one might want from a review platform like G2.
What they disliked about the product: I have no issues at this time. Only thing I note is that while we have a lot of reviews, there is a strong weight put to recent reviews and in my opinion not enough weight put on older reviews.

Review title: More eyes - more leads
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: A world-class customer support and success management team that will go the extra mile for you right from the start. The management of review campaigns and overall profile content is seamless and self-explanatory.
What they disliked about the product: It would be nice to have some integration capabilities with the essential tier subscription.

Review title: Very Intuitive & Helpful Platform
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I really like using G2, specifically for the review generation component. It makes it really easy to send customers incentivized review requests and we have a much higher review response rate vs. other review sites. It's also really easy to implement within our organization and to get additional MQLs from the platform.
What they disliked about the product: The only thing that I don't really like is that it some leads don't directly integrate.

Review title: The G2 customer success team is top notch!
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: I find the G2 intent signals to be the most beneficial solution we currently utilize. They are ease to implement and use within the vendor portal. As a sale tool for prospecting you truly can't beat it!
What they disliked about the product: It can be difficult to keep content fresh with the quarterly updates to new badges published. Would recommend switching to a bi-annual badge release calendar.

Review title: A true partnership, supporting our P2P journey
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: Since day one our relationship with our G2 team has been nothing short of amazing, responsive, eager to supprt our needs and truly vested in our sucess!

As it realtes to the platform, I appreciate that reviewers can be non annomous - lending us to use this platform as another avenue to recieve our customers feedback with reagrds to our product. It allso allows us to work on additional initative like engaging with our customers based on their reviews. The ability to reuse customer quotes in campaigns, celebrate our wins with quarterly badging, increase our SEO as it aligns to our buyers journey - show how we rank to our competitors all additional value. Customers want to hear from other customers and this platform gives us a sounding board to make that happen.
What they disliked about the product: it was unfortunate that we had guite a bit of "bad actors" slip though at the beginng causing us to lose numerous review dropiing ur ranking unexpectidly - granted we have experience bad actors with other vendors thus nature of the incentivized ask

Review title: A much needed asset for any marketing team

The ease of use is incredibly simple and user friendly.
What they disliked about the product: No current downsides. I have been an admin on a larger marketing team and a smaller, and have not run into any issues.

Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is an intuitive online review software which is helpful for us in driving reviews and improving our reputation among our competitors.

Review title: Great marketing platform, exceptional customer service and business partners, easy to use
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: We've really enjoyed working with the G2 platform and tooling, and also with the team. Our sales experience was very positive, and our CSM has been incredibly knowledgeable and helpful every step of the way from the initial kickoff call and beyond. We even expanded to include more products 3 quarters before we expected to based on the positive experience we've had and plan to expand more when we renew this year.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to state here at this time. We've really had a positive experience so far.

Review title: Great platform and customer support
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love the platform and the way it helps us gain valuable feedback from our customers around the world. It is very intuitive and easy to use and offers great tools to analyze and get market intelligence. Moreover, their customer support is very helpful and quick to reply and asses any issue we may encounter.
What they disliked about the product: There's nothing I don't like about G2 platform

Review title: Target in-market audiences w/ automatic LinkedIn integration
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: The ability to target in-market audiences with the LinkedIn integration. The audience builder is simple but in-depth, and audiences synchronize automatically to LinkedIn. Integration with LinkedIn Campaign Manager is quick. Audiences also update automatically. We have had success with a bottom of funnel LinkedIn ad targeting in-market companies based on G2 audiences, layered w/ appropriate job title/seniority/etc. targeting.
What they disliked about the product: I believe the limitation is due to privacy considerations, but contact-level targeting/insights would be preferable to account-level/company lists. There are only 3 levels of Buying Activity and Intent, it would be nice to be able to customize that further, i.e. "X visits to our page during the time frame", or "visited at least Y number of product profiles in the category"

Review title: We leverage G2 buyer intent data through LinkedIn to help drive highly qualified, lower funnel leads
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love that G2 gives you the options of employee count, buying state, and minimum activity level when you are creating your audiences.
What they disliked about the product: So far we haven't run into downsides of using G2.

Review title: Essential Marketing Solution for SaaS Company
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The ease of use and support. G2 is an essential piece in our overall marketing plan and we are in the dashboard at least once/day responding to reviews, finding content to share, measuring our placement on the grid, analyzing performance and more. The user resources are extremely helpful, but what we like best is that you don't have to go to the resources very often. The UI is very user friendly, so you don't have to go hunting for help.
What they disliked about the product: No downside that I've found after using it for 2+ years.

Review title: A great platform for user validation
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: Having a single, intuitive platform to garner third party reviews at scale for users / third party validation and for collecting valuable product feedback. Great account support too!
What they disliked about the product: The ambiguity of some product/company presence in some markets.

Review title: G2 is an overall excellent platform!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: What makes G2 great is it credibility and authority.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing - G2 is an excellent platform in itself

Review title: Great Review Platform with Quality Leads
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: They usually have very good quality leads using their site for research on software. We usually receive leads that convert into demos and move further in our pipeline than other platform leads.
What they disliked about the product: The only thing I feel that would be helpful would be to have an easier process for those who want to leave a review, a lot of the times clients don't want to sign in or create an account and have an issue with connecting their socials.

Review title: Great platform and services to get noticed
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 marketing provides a great platform to get your technology in front of potential users, especially if you sell within a crowded market. In addition, their customer success team does a great job advising customers where they can get their best return on investment, and frequently shares resources to help you get noticed on G2.
What they disliked about the product: This may be somewhat unique to our organization, but their campaigns are less impactful if your product doesn't fit one of their defined categories. It can be difficult to rise above the 'noise' in some of the broader categories.

Review title: Another Tool You Need in Your Customer Marketing Toolbelt
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The product intent data and content subscriptions are the 2 most valuable features of G2 Marketing Solutions as a customer marketer. Additionally, initial implementation was fairly quick and easy, and the many integrations with other marketing tools have also been key to the success of my customer marketing programs.
What they disliked about the product: Review requirements are less strict than other product review platforms, and reviews can sometimes be on the lighter side from a content perspective.

Review title: Great customer support!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: I love how involded our CSM is! She is helpful and comes to our meetings very prepared with ideas and suggestions. Our Account Manager is also involded when needed. G2 integrates well with Influititve and is easy to use on the backend. We haven't had any big issues.
What they disliked about the product: I wasn't around when we first started using G2 so I don't have any knowledge around implementation.

Review title: Excellent
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: G2 Is a highly reputable website and allows our customers to review us honestly. The portal is really easy to use and I have particuarly found the new AI reply feature really helpful, especially when we're so busy. Running campaigns is really simple, we supply a list and G2 looks after everything. I think the best thing about G2 though is the support from our Account Manager; whether it's assisting with campaigns, helping us produce video reviews or the constant feedback about where we are and how we can improve.
What they disliked about the product: There really isn't much to dislike about G2, I would recommend it to everyone to use as a 3rd Party review site.

Review title: Essential tool  for boosting our reputation and presence
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions is easy to use and implement, but pairing G2 with the support from our Customer Success and Account team has been the ultimate package. We had a presence on G2 before launching our program but the support from G2 has taken it to the next level. 
We're laucnhing campaigns, integrating our intent data with our systems, and implementing closed loop processes into our reviews. G2's team has helped with collateral, best practices, and our implementation strategy.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing to dislike! I've been satisfied with G2 so far.

Review title: Awesome Product Review Platform
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 is an awesome, user-friendly platform. Mike Sabin and Jeremy Lee have been an amazing support. It is also very interactive for admins and customers. I have been able to implement and integrate programs and tools to keep track of leads and monitor progress. I would highly recommend G2 to friends and colleagues.
What they disliked about the product: I have not encountered anything that I dislike about this platform.

Review title: A lot of really useful tools in one place
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: It's great to have the live widgets to keep track of where our products are sitting on the grid, and the badges that go with these. The G2 interface is really user friendly, and it's quick and easy to pull reports and marketing material to use in marketing material.
We have a great relationship with our Account Manager and Customer Success Manager which makes the whole process a lot more streamlined
What they disliked about the product: It would be useful to have an easier way to export all reviews into an CSV with all questions, not just an overview

Review title: G2 captures peer reviews, data and more to better understand our customers and drive pipeline
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 provides vital ease of use information to better understand our customer's product usage, lifecycle experience and likes / dislikes, as well as understanding how we (the vendor) fit into the market ecosystem. Other key data elements include better understanding: Who are the competitiors and their strenghts and weaknesses? Who is looking for a new solution - company, location?  They are excellent at capturing the practioner's voice.  Their customer support is extremely strong and responsive.
What they disliked about the product: G2 might need to create stronger links with senior management and leadership in organizations - and capture their voice.

Review title: An industry leader in tech customer reviews!
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: The vendor portal is extremely user-friendly and there are always helpful updates being made to improve user experience. I love the ability for reviewers to opt-in as references, this adds a lot of business value to our investment. All our CSMs have also been top-notch quality, so incredibly attentive, friendly, and proactive. It's also great that we can add in our own customer review questions! The webhooks is also an incredible feature that comes with our paid product profiles. The leads generated from these webhooks really helps to outrightly prove the value of our investment to leadership.
What they disliked about the product: The biggest downside is not being able to incentivize reviews for non-subscribed products. I feel like this unfairly skews ratings and reviews across products. I wish that the platform offered an annual or bi-annual option for all vendors to load funds for an ad-hoc review collection campaign without vendors having to pay for an entire subscription. Also, we gather many reviews through review sourcing campaigns, but the reviews often times aren't the highest quality, because the review form is very simple. I wish their was a middle ground of the intricateness of the G2 & TR review forms. There is also a frequent tech issues that I run into when I'm inside the vendor portal. When I'm switching from a subscribed product to a non-subscribed product and back to a subscribed product, the subscribed product info begins to display like a non-subscribed product. I always have to refresh the page and navigate directly back to the subscribed product for the normal view to resume.

Review title: Great tech and excellent service
Rating: 5.0

Review title: Great Platform for Software Peer Reviews
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions is a platform that helps software vendors like Deltek reach more buyers, build trust, and grow their business.
What they disliked about the product: The review process can be long for customers and hard to navigate. Additionally: It can be expensive for some marketers, especially small businesses or startups, who may not have the budget to invest in G2’s products and services. It can be challenging to convert the leads generated by G2 into paying customers, as they may not be ready to buy or may have different expectations. And, it can be competitive to stand out among the thousands of software vendors who are also using G2 to market their solutions, and to maintain a high ranking and rating on G2’s categories

Review title: Great platform for showcasing your product

Review title: Useful Marketing Tools for Targeted Campaigns
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: We focus on generating reviews with G2 and it's a great added benefit to sync their marketing tools with our own marketing stack.

What they disliked about the product: The backend has a lot of details and is not always intuitive.

Review title: Best Analysis model to build trust
Rating: 4.5
What they liked about the product: The most helpful about G2 Marketing Solution is the real people and real reviews.
What they disliked about the product: When you are positioned next to American giants, the search has more technical approach and it makes it harder to users with less familiarity with business software

Review title: G2 is an essential tool for Procurement teams
Rating: 5.0
What they liked about the product: G2 Marketing Solutions is an essential tool for Procurement Organization when we meet with Operation teams to strategize about upcoming renewals/potential new software/hardware we plan to acquire.  G2 gives an accurate competitive picture of potential solutions, and is a great first step to determine alternative solutions that our Operations team should explore.  We found that information on competitors is very accurate.  As a procurement leader of 10+, I have successfully used G2 as a one-stop shop to determine vendors that could best solve a particular software or hardware challenge.
What they disliked about the product: Nothing comes to mind.  I really appreciate this tool.

Review title: We use g2 to drive traffic to our website
Rating: 4.0
What they liked about the product: We could convert a few clients from g2 listing
What they disliked about the product: So many features are paid, and also the software which is paying more will be listed higher in the list regardless of the reviews count.

The review process is very long for our customers, it would be much better only to ask a few questions (like what you like / dislike) and make all other fields optional ...
