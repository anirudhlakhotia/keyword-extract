Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2 has helped our customers publicly validate us to prospects and has helped us build pipeline and be considered for opportunities where we likely would not have been found otherwise. Also it has aided as a great validation point for customers in meetings and demo's as to our market profile and position.  It has helped us need less reference calls and enabled our customers to have a more open and valid place to voice their opinion on us.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: As a Community Manager I am responsible for crafting and executing our advocate program. Perhaps the most challenging aspect of creating an advocate program is finding the advocates. Advocately has eliminated challenge. The advocates, through Advocately, came to me! Not only do I now have a growing list of advocates, but I am able to see exactly what they love about our software. This enables me to push feedback to the marketing, development, and customer success teams so that we can enhance what people love.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: Getting good reviews isn't easy. It takes time, consideration, and often gets pushed aside by other projects. Advocately does the asking and consideration for us, so that it doesn't get pushed aside. 

Along with the massive help Advocately has provided me with our advocate marketing plan, it has also enhanced our SEO efforts. Many of the organic search results we obtained are fueled by customer reviews. Social proof is a HUGE influencer in our marketing efforts. 

Another extremely important aspect of Advocately is that we are able to identify our users who don't love the product. This gives us the opportunity to reach out to provide further support so that they can learn to love our software. As a company is it SO important to listen to what users experience and Advocately makes this so easy.

Questiontype: love
Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I used to go through a lot of steps to get reviews. I was probably spending 5-6 hours a month to get reviews. There were so many manual steps and we would barely get any reviews out of it. It always felt worth it because our Brand and reputation is very important to us. Now, with Advocately, I just set up campaigns and they take care of the rest. We initially tested it out on 40 users and within that we produced 20 reviews!!!!! The same subset of users would probably would have produced 2 or 3 reviews within my old process. 

Also, the support has been amazing! Patrick has extremely helpful at setting us up and guiding us through the onboarding process. He has been very flexible in the hours he has helped and I've always very quickly got a response to questions.

And within the first day of getting setup on Advocately, we ran our first NPS survey, got dozens of responses, which Advocately then automatically reached out to - and we got our first 5 star review on that day itself.

G2 crowd allows me to provide referrals to prospects, without having to annoy my customers, before my prospects are fully qualified.

I have some questions around the market presence algorithm but can understand why it needs to remain secret.  Finally, I think some of the reports - especially around usability and ease of set-up - currently mitigate against larger vendors with more sophisticated solutions; these feel a little unfair.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2Crowd has invested heavily in advertising their brand versus the other review sites.  As a result they have a much bigger quantity of reviews.  So it has traction now and people trust it to create a shortlist and to determine what others think.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2Crowd rank not given enough prominence. Don't like paid for reviews (think this should be charity donation only) as encourages people to make up reviews.  I think there should be some way of seeing the balance of reviews from particular companies (at the moment you could have 100 reviews from a single customer which could skew review count).

Answers: G2 Crowd provides a very impartial and fully verified technology software review forum. The technology sections are well defined and nicely summarized.  Overall, it's very professional and you can actually count on the review provided since they can't be manipulated by the vendors.   Really like the way that we can embed the review widgets on our own website with links to our optimized landing page.  The environment provides a great user experience for visitors to our website and illustrates how open we are to input from our customers. The style of review presentation is also very easy for visitors to consume. It's similar to consumer based review sites, but with much higher data quality.  We count on the fact that prospects reading our reviews can trust the customer input.

Answers: We have been working with G2 Crowd since 2014 when they first released their quadrant for expense management providers. Our original intent for working with G2 Crowd was to provide an unbiased set of competitive data in a report that we could share with our prospects during the buying cycle. Now nearly four years later, we have grown our spend with G2 Crowd by 300%+, sponsor 3-4 reports a year, sponsor banner ads and manage a lead generation effort through this channel. G2 Crowd has proven to be a successful method for generating quality leads and delivering an ROI, year after year.

From a technology standpoint, I really value the competitive analysis aspect of G2 Crowd. The fact that a prospect can search and compare over 1,000 reviews on expense management in minutes and rank the top performing vendors is really invaluable. Having this Yelp-like review process for business software has allowed us to showcase our strengths against competitors and replace the traditional client referral process.

Answers: I originally signed up with G2 Crowd to generate awareness of our solution as they had the most product/ competitor reviews for our industry (PR tools and media targeting) and had a robust process to help you generate reviews for products.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The system could be a bit more intuitive and cleaner for end users coming to look at reviews. You guys should get rid of that grid. It is confusing as heck. I am not a proponent of copy catting all the time, but on this one you could just take a que from Yelp or Tripadvisor in terms of how to present the best company in each category.  A list view is much better and simpler.  Also, I think you guys should better figure out the right companies that should be in a respective category. For us, there are people in our category whose primary product is not in our category yet they are able to rank higher than us in our category because they got more reviews in there primary category. It's a bit misleading I think for the end users relying on your site for reviews.

The reviews written on G2 Crowd are comprehensive and very useful for consumers. 

They're growing their marketing tools, and we're trying a few of them out. 

I like the backend options for building out our profile to best educate our prospects on the value of our service. You can upload videos, FAQs, and key details about the software.  Their reporting features are relevant and accurate as well.

Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: We're trying out their sponsored content marketing program, but it's in its early stages and hasn't produced impressive results yet. It could be due to the ad design, but we'd like to see better results.

Their webhooks feature for leads is a little confusing, if you don't have any web dev experience.

The evaluation grid seems to favor market size, so if you don't work with enterprise businesses, you will never be labeled as a 'market leader' despite having a top notch review portfolio. 

The comparison reports are overpriced for smaller startups.

G2C isn't a huge source of demo requests, but the awareness from this website is good.

SurveyID: 354532
Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: It's impossible (or at least very hard) to quantify the ROI. You can track your demo requests from G2C in Salesforce and measure that ROI, but I think the true value of G2C lies in the TOFU brand awareness you get from people viewing your page. And the data you get about your pageviews is not good. You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of "Comcast LLC viewed your page") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C. Maybe it's a great first touch channel, but you'll never really know.

Questiontype: service_task_overview
Questions: Describe the project or task G2 Marketing Solutions helped with:
Answers: We use this site in a variety of different ways.  First of all, as Customer Satisfaction is very important to us, we use it to gauge how happy our users genuinely are, with our products.  

Equally as important, as a sales leader, we also use this site for references.  All prospects will eventually ask for references prior to making a purchase.  As our business unit is growing quickly, this can often cause reference fatigue as they are hit up over and over again.  Plus, IMO the reference process isn't perfect anyway for the prospect, as they will be biased.  So instead, we have our salespeople just point their prospects to G2Crowd instead.  "Instead of me giving you the names of my 5 best customers, why don't you go to G2Crowd instead?  There you'll find verified reviews of actual users (not analysts that have never used the tools themselves), of our solution as well as our competitors.  And then from there you can do as many backdoor references as you'd like."  

This is win/win.  The prospect gets better reviews from users, that aren't prepped or set up....and we get our reference checks.

Questiontype: service_task_overview
Questions: Describe the project or task G2 Marketing Solutions helped with:
Answers: While most businesses have now realized the importance of well-written content for their websites, there is one specific type of content that is widely embraced by all, reviews of your business, in one centralized location where others come to make key business buying decisions.

For marketers of Cazoomi, we need to get into the mix of those spec & select decisions where B2B readers, decision makers or influencers, translate into potential buyers. 

We engaged G2 to get cool B2B Infographics, Comparative reports, and key product marketing advice, which is one of the most targeted approaches to comparative based content we think. This allows our small marketing team to engage SMEs at G2 who hail from the Integration industry and know our business well.  We can then share our unique client stories with them and be creatively involved with the story we want to express to the B2B buyer who really relies on reviews and expert content when making decisions which affect not only yearly budgets but also sensitive data migration and integration compliance projects.

As a bonus, all the research and infographics are easily shareable, which makes them a great asset to use in social media platforms, email campaigns, and other digital channels our marketing team use to inform potential integration software buyers.

Overall, I could not say enough about the decision this 2017 to work with G2 to augment our product comparative marketing efforts.

Looking forward to each year penciling them into our yearly marketing budget as well.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: We upgraded to license the grid and badge for our category.  Unfortunately, “Leader” badges are only added/updated on your profile when a report for the category which you are a Leader in is generated. There is no report scheduled for the category which are are a “Leader” in.

G2Crowd should update badges on profile when/as companies move around on the grid, otherwise the profile pages are inaccurate. In the category description it says "Leaders include: [our brand]" but our profile is reflecting we are a “High Performer” when we are actually a “Leader.”

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2Crows is the best unfiltered and comprehensive platform to learn about strengths and weaknesses of various b2b tech in the market both established and contending.

The comparisons are also great because they turn unstructured written reviews into actionable and measurable data across a range of metrics.  This means a decision maker can choose to focus on overall ratings, specific features, or the various rich and qualitative reviews.

What's more, all of this is based on validated profiles, so no fake reviews.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: This platform is adding a new dimension to how we market and sell to our customers.  The insight that can be shared from reviews and where users spend their time whilst on the platform allows marketers to form a view on who their buyers are and what they are interested in.

G2Crowd is changing the way we all learn about, evaluate and purchase b2b software. We don't go out to eat somewhere new without checking out tripadvisor or yelp and we certainly don't book a holiday before checking out reviews and pictures from people who have actually been there.  G2Crowd brings this piece of mind to b2b software. It amazes that many companies still make significant purchasing decisions on outdated and obscure reviews from old school analysts who have probably never used the product.

G2Crows is solving for a massively underserved market of buyer and sellers who could all do with more transparency and trust!

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The platform lacks multi-language support and is too much USA oriented. Software market is global and even when most of activities are ok being in English, there are a lot of reviewers out there that feel more comfortable writing something as personal as a review in their own language. On the other hand, G2 Crowd is struggling to get on the top (if it hasn't already) of the Software Review credibility and reputation score table. They do effords commuincating their platform to the USA market and USA software consumers, that efford would be welcome in other languages and countries too.

The G2 Crowd team has taken the time & effort to talk to us, understand how we can get the best value out of their platform and give us options that work well with the goals and needs of our business.

Answers: The user interface is a little too cluttered. There seem to be some issues visual hierarchy. This makes it difficult for one to quickly understand the great reports they have to offer which is a shame. Also, this is minor, but the "chat here" option appears to often. It is common to have a chat icon in the bottom right of the screen but it's also repeated in several other areas of the site which makes the site feel to cluttered and too "salesy". I honestly believe more people would visit g2 if the user interface felt less cluttered.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Lack of data connector within the premium package has limited us to evaluate customer journey between Salesforce and G2 Crowd. As a result, we have not been able to evaluate ROI goals from the platform. I would recommend the development to consider introducing support for data connectors like -  Salesforce, Google Analytics, AdRoll. Also, there should be a  customization support for the profile tailored to client needs.

Questiontype: love
Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I love the awareness G2 Crowd offers for our product. If someone is simply searching on Google for a CRM system, G2 Crowd pops up and offers all these products with REAL customer reviews. I think that is extremely valuable to both shoppers and companies. G2 Crowd gets hundreds to thousands of people scrolling through their site daily, which offers a great amount of awareness to our product.

One other thing I HAVE to praise is the G2 Crowd staff. Bliss Billingsley was incredibly helpful throughout our training/implementation phase and was always quick to email or call when I had questions. Just last week she transitioned us along to Ashley McDermott, our Relationship Manager. While I'm sad to no longer work with Bliss, I'm equally as excited to work with Ashley and improve our ranking even more!

Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The only complaint I have is that they sent the review emails to our customers back to back. G2 Crowd sends 3 emails to notify your customers to leave reviews and earn gift cards, but I was really hoping we'd be offered the chance to choose the dates of these emails. They sent all 3 emails back to back over a 3 day period, which in my opinion wasn't enough space between emails. Maybe just give customers the option in the future of when to send the emails.
*Disclaimer: I may have had the option to choose and just forgot/didn't realize it...

I must also say the Account Executive with whom I worked on understanding this market and then ultimately purchasing the software was incredibly helpful and consultative.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: We are the stand out leader in our space, with more (happy!) customers than anyone in our space. This is validated by third party analysts, e.g. Gartner, but the voice of our customers was not captured at scale. The primary goal was to have our customers share their experience with our software. However, a secondary benefit is our ability to directly share feedback with out Product Management team. Not happy about a feature or want to do something else with our product(s)? Now our customers have another avenue to share this information.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Our initial performance goals were around lead generation and brand visibility on the leader grids. Quite frankly, we weren't seeing any leads or any placement on the grid until we were able to obtain a lot of positive customer reviews, unfortunately 11 months into the annual contract. Now we have started to see some regular activity and great progress on the effectiveness.  The intent program is very expensive and it will be difficult to justify our ROI given our relatively low cost of acquisition needed for our ROI.

Answers: The support the G2 Crowd team has been incredible. Marty is so responsive and had really pushed us to adopt the proven strategies that have worked very well for other G2 Crowd clients. He's been right about everything and we're seeing very quick results and dramatic improvements to our grid ranking and success in obtain new customer reviews.  We are a global business so it's important to us that G2 Crowd is a global product review site -- we hear from prospects and global team members how important this platform is from across various regions in the ecommerce/subs/payment processing technology buying process.  Looking forward to expanding our efforts and further investment in this marketing channel.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Setting up our company page was very straight forward with a robust list of capabilities, categories and detail to add.  At minimum these profile pages should be set up.

After being able to build up reviews in a relatively short period of time we then turned to utilizing the Grid Reports to help drive engagement/leads as well as establishing our place in the market. 

The Grid Reports were our #2 asset driving engagement and lead gen in our LinkedIn advertising program.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: With the growth of our reviews on our pages as well as how we are rated from our customers we have been identified by G2Crowd as a leader in our market with a couple of our products. This certainly helps to build up credibility with our brand, helps to establish ourselves as a strong player in the market and to consider when choosing a solution in our space. 

With the program now up and running for a few months, almost a year actually, we are now also realizing that while there is value in driving clicks and leads from this space it actually is also a strong way to identify who is actively comparing vendors in the market and including or NOT including us in that search. This has caused us to look into how can we incorporate these indicators into our marketing/sales motions to prioritize our plans.

While I don't doubt the broader value of the platform (and the exposed visitor data gives very clear evidence of a role it's playing in the buying process), it's tougher to assign value to that in a ROI focused environment at a large corp with established sales systems.

Answers: G2Crowd is becoming a part of the buyer journey that we can't ignore. By driving more reviews, our profile becomes an increasingly good picture of what our customers love about us - and helps point to where we can improve. By working directly with G2Crowd, we're better equipped to reach out to our customers to gather reviews. We've also, with their assistance, found more ways to use our reviews as part of our sales process, arming our sales team with real quotes from real customers to help prospects decide whether to buy.

As a seller, I love that i have such an incredible resource to direct my prospects to, and some of G2C's premium (paid) services are very unique and helpful. My favorites are:
-G2 being a lead source, in it of its self
-the buyer intent data (which organizations are passively or actively exploring our services) piped right into our Salesforce account records/reporting which help us activate conversations we might otherwise not
-the ability to create personalized landing pages of curated customer reviews for prospects, based on what concerns or use cases they have been outspoken about (adoption, implementation, onboarding etc.)

We also really love working with the team at G2 Crowd. Danny took extreme care to understand our company needs and expectations, and even sent us a signed "thank-you" note after our first webinar. (Who does this? Uhm...Danny does!) Our implementation specialist Kelly slowly and meticulously explained how to get our listing set-up. She transformed a super daunting job into very easy subtasks, and weekly met with us to review our progress. It was like eating an elephant, one bite at a time...but with less mandible engagement. Ashley, our main point of contact at G2 Crowd, has overseen our entire G2 Crowd journey, and is quick to resolve any concerns we have. Like, greased lightning fast!

One observation is that G2 Crowd prizes quality reviews, and there can sometimes be a delay between review date and the day it posts to your account. Don't wig out: It's TOTALLY normal! They will carefully vet all reviews to make sure they are being submitted by actual software users. Fake news, fake reviews, Pokemon -- the team at G2 Crowd catches it all.

Answers: Metadata has experienced phenomenal success with buyer intent data from G2Crowd. The way we operationalize the data is two ways:

1 - Outbound emailing particular personas within accounts visiting our page/category section, using the attributes provided by G2Crowd as a way to personalize the email.

2 - Execute account-based advertising campaigns (using metadata.io), targeting the right personas within those exact accounts with personalized content.

Within the first month of running these operations, metadata.io has generated a clear ROI for our investment that revived a lost opportunity into CLOSED WON opportunity, closed an additional new new deal (6-figure deal), and generated dozens of opt-in leads/conversions from those accounts visiting our category page, our competitors page or our own page on G2Crowd. All from the first month.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I like the fact G2 Crowd is disrupting the old, stale way of running market evaluations of solutions. They crowdsource it from the users which is what I believe buyers are looking for throughout their purchase decision. As a sales rep, I can leverage the voice of our customer to address questions, objections, and similar initiatives with our active sales cycles. In a world of SaaS solutions, the voice of the customer is paramount. What I like best is the unique access to engage with prospects that are in a research phase by providing unfiltered perspective from our customers.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Love how turn-key things have been thus far, as well as the attitude of the G2 crowd team (shoutout Mike, Pete, and Walter). These guys are on top of it. We just finished up our first review campaign and more than doubled our number of reviews (80+ new reviews), which we can now use to inform new product features and make improvements all around going into the new year. Best part—it was wildly simple to set up and launch.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2 Crowd obviously has a strong interest—like any tech company—in ensuring we become heavily integrated within their platform and remain customers for the foreseeable future. A few times that's come across just a little too strong, at least to our liking (lots of communications and calls to set up integrations we don't necessarily need on our end at the moment). Not really a deal breaker but we're a small, bootstrapped team that just needs a bit of consideration for what we can do at a reasonable pace. Other than that, not much to dislike about this platform and their team.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: 1. For our use case, 80% of the traffic was net new.
2. Of the 20% we already had, a significant correlation was present to opportunities which shows value in the remaining 80%. This is continuing to test out positively.
3. The total traffic was way too much to use (1k+ unique companies every few months with conversion rates below 2%), but thankfully you can see exactly what each company is looking at. Sorting unique hits by page type, and then seeing which page types correlates to opportunities, allows me to handpick a workable amount of net new Leads to deliver to my sales team which convert at a forecast of over 12% (average). Not bad for Leads we haven't even touched!

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: My biggest hurtle with G2 was the Leads integration. I was told I "could get the data any way I wanted" prior to buying. When installing, and realizing it was missing this key feature, I pinged the team. They're still a little young, and therefore overpromised. 

However, this turned out to be a very positive experience, because they designed and implemented a new API specific to my needs, and fast. Turns out they could get it to me any way I wanted, I just had to wait a few weeks. I now have a Leads API that gets me the data, how and when I need it. They're already listening to the next product advancements, and I feel confident the product will continue to grow beyond its existing value, which is already at this point quite significant.

The team was fast, effective, and easy to work with during the update; Couldn't be happier. G2 boyscout here, if you're charged with Demand Generation, Lead Generation, Scoring, or most anything relevant with Leads - there's a way for you to leverage this data and get value by the boat load.

Answers: Too many to list here, but i'll cover the basics:

2. Importing Net New companies with activity on data points with high correlations to Opps and routing them (lead gen)
3. Identifying existing customers looking into the space to identify churn (churn prevention)
4. Coming Soon - coloring in the Account. G2 has clearbit data, and the moment they finish porting everything into Salesforce i'll be using this to fill in if the company is the right fit via size, funding, etc. (demographic scoring)

Answers: Outside of a direct request for information, I love the insight into what products or service a target account is looking at, before, during, and after the selling process. I primarily use the buying signals to decide which company to reach out to and which team to reach out to based on buying behavior, but I also use the signals for retention purposes. Knowing my accounts are looking at other products lets me know to reach out before they become a churn risk.

Answers: The personal touch from account reps and teams was amazing from day one. They were super helpful and proactively walked me through the process of getting started and figuring out my questions. The website is by far one of the best websites I've used for admin and features. Love the website and it's the poster-child for usability, tooltips and being well organized.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: We're really not seeing much as far as leads or traction from the platform as we'd like, but I was warned that G2 is not a big lead generating platform. We hope that the reviews are helping to feed other organic channels, but we'll never really know. I also don't like that they cap the amount of leads they're willing to give you each year, even though extra leads might be coming in. That sounds silly. But, my problem is getting even close to that number to begin with.

Answers: In the last 12 months, our Salesforce CPQ Grid position has been my go-to slide for demonstrating our customer’s success with prospects. It’s one thing to deliver the company talk track around ease of use, speed, and functionality -- it’s another to reinforce the story with authentic G2 reviews that are collected from users just like them. 

As a best practice, I strongly recommend leveraging G2 reviews to authenticate your sales conversations. The market we work in can get extremely competitive and it’s important to cut through the noise, quickly. I do this by sending prospects to a reputable source of truth on how users are getting value from what we provide.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Overall, I like the way G2 looks at markets, but the way that G2 calculates "Market Presence"— the Y-axis in Grid Reports — could use some improvement. It uses 15 factors like Number of Employees, Revenue, Web Presence, and  Social Presence. This gives large companies with hundreds of products and thousands of employees a distinct advantage over specialists that are better known in a given market. Companies like IBM and Microsoft will always score well in Market Presence because of their sheer size, even if they have only a handful of employees working on a given product.

Answers: It was seamless to get up and running with G2 Crowd.  Ali was essential in helping us figure out a game plan to increase our presence on this site and listened to the approach that we wanted to take.  I loved that we could have unique landing pages for our CS team to track inbound reviews and our customers seemed more open to posting reviews knowing they could post anonymously. I also really like being able to customize a reference page that we can keep relevant with recent reviews so that our sales team can leverage this in their conversations.  Having a personal dashboard where you can track all reviews, their status on posting as well as the reward payout is also a plus.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Some of our customers did express some frustration with getting the reviews to post, but it most likely was due to user error (not completing email verification or wanting to connect via LinkedIn).  While we did try and coach customers through this, some were not willing to take these additional steps and in turn, caused the reviews not to be posted.  There also was not an exact match for our industry within the drop down list, so sometimes our customers were unsure how to correctly complete all fields that were required.

Answers: I plan to ask our CSM, but I don't believe there is a good way for us to share the positive comments from reviews on our website. They do have the review snapshot widget, but it is not very configurable i.e. it doesn't really work on our website. Thus, we are not able to share the good review using them as social proof on our site.

The software is also really easy to use, so it was a smooth onboarding process and it's been really easy to add new team members with minimal training. The sales and onboarding team were also super helpful in working with us through the process. When we were onboarding, Ali provided detailed follow-ups for us with action items and next steps. I had to contact support once and it was really easy and the rep, Leah, really went above and beyond contacting technical support to resolve my issue.

Answers: As a vendor, I don't think the administration site is as easy to use as it could be.  Or maybe it could just be organized better. It seems like every time I turn around there is something else that I haven't heard of before. Maybe it's just me, but I would like to see an outline of all the steps involved in creating your initial profile and then what can be added later.

Questiontype: love
Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The best thing about G2 is how the plan and onboarding are tailored to our business case. This has meant that the implementation and customer success team from G2 has been able to help us towards reaching our goals instead of "just" showing us the platform.
Also, we've gotten specific examples and cases of how to best use the G2 features for us, and together we've already set goals for what we want to achieve together.
We've been using G2 for a few years now, and we've seen great results in review generation and, more importantly, lead generation and sales. 
The Buyer Intent data available to us has really helped us out in many different ways, and we now use the data in marketing, sales, and customer success.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I've found a few places where the documentation of features doesn't seem to be updated completely. An example could be for the different widgets, where it's not very clear how they are actually going to look. A few images/examples (maybe just with dummy data) would be great to show precisely what a widget does and how it'll look when implemented.

Getting more and better, reviews have really helped us stand out in a competitive category, and works great as user-generated content that can provide social proof of our products.

Buyer Intent data has since helped us solve another big problem: identifying active buyers in our category. The customer journey is long and complex in our industry, so identifying key accounts that are actively researching products has helped us immensely in terms of lead generation and sales.

Answers: Their reporting needs improvement. G2 had a helpful ROI tool. It synced with Salesforce and would map buyer intent to your opportunities to know whether G2 buyer intent happened on an opp before or during an opp (lead gen vs influence). Unfortunately, they pulled this tool to re-tool it. For now, it's hard to truly measure the impact of G2 buyer intent (without the right resources on your end to configure Salesforce and the G2 SFDC connector to make pull off the same or similar ROI reporting).

And on top of that, the assets that they provide our team with are designed according to our brand guidelines... lightening the load for our creative team.

I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention our fantastic account team. Jeremy Levin has been an incredible resource for us as we've grown into new categories and analyzed competitors.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I would love to understand more, from a competitive perspective, how other vendors are able to rank on specific grids. There are cases where some vendors are on a specific grid that I don't believe belong, and it's difficult to understand how they got there and create a "dismiss" talk track for our sellers.

For example, why is competitor "X" listed under grid "A?" There are specific rules that vendors must follow in order to rank on a grid, but in my opinion, it's not specific enough to truly understand what our sellers are up against.

- We've seen a jump in conversions after replacing a G2 competitor's reviews on key website pages with G2's curated review feed, in part, because we can cater the reviews to the specific need the web page is addressing.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: We've been on the Power Plan for nearly 8 months, slow to adopt all of the paid features available to us. Those we've leveraged: Upgraded Profile, Testimonial Widget, Customer Reference Page, and Real-Time Leads. We're soon to embrace the Marketo lead webhooks and buyer intent integration. What do I like best? Admin Portal ease-of-use. Platform is super intuitive. Intent data, marketing content and other analytics are easily accessible via MyG2 menu, no need to hunt. Customer reference pages are easy to build, too. Support from Customer Success is great.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: We've not yet leveraged all of the paid features available to us, can only speak to those we have: nothing to dislike at this point, really. I do, at times, feel pressured, sometimes rushed, to utilize plan to fullest potential (understandably, as CS team is eager to prove value), and felt the onboarding process was hurried, though we're not quite there yet. Baby steps is how we roll.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: We onboarded G2 with hopes of generating more product reviews, have a larger presence in the market, be equally, if not more, visible than our competitors. A formal review strategy was not in place prior to our purchase of the Power Plan though we knew we needed one, are still working up a viable program best suited to our needs. Again, we've not yet leveraged all features, though benefits we have seen: an uptick in reviews, greater visibility/credibility in the market, category leadership (and accompanying badges).

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: As one of the leading SaaS review sites, I view G2 as a "necessary evil'. We need to have a presence on G2, and a good one at that.

We have not seen success with automated review generation, and thus have to invest a lot of time and money in order to see the return. The number of reviews is important, which means that bigger companies with more customers are at an inherent advantage over startups or growing companies. 

I wish we could set up unique review links ourselves instead of having to rely on our account team. They are always on top of it, but seems like something we could/should be able to do easily ourselves.

On the product side, we get good insights into customer sentiment and competitive intelligence. The quarterly Grid reports are a forcing function to ensure we are continuously generating new reviews and customer feedback. 

Grid reports help arm sales with third-party validation of our product. There is likely more we can be doing here.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Review generation options and intent alerts base on the categories of choice are remarkable options. From one side, the ability to run review campaigns across LinkedIn and targeted outreach from the G2 team is flawless, plus having a dedicated reviews link for specific tactics makes it even easier to drive reviews across different tactics. 

Intent alerts serve multiple use cases (anything from outreach prioritization, personalized messaging, or determine at-risk accounts who may be shopping for competitors) , and G2 makes it easy to integrate it with your CRM or even directly to Outreach.

Finally, the support from Jeremy and Mike (CSM and AE) is amazing. They are available to bring new ideas to the table and even give you friendly nudges to keep you on track with projects.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I am the primary user of G2. I like G2 because it's quick and easy for my customer to share their thoughts and feelings about their experience using my company's products. Partnering with my Enterprise Customer Success Manager, Carly Cozad, and Strategic Account Executive, Nick Espey, we've landed on the right strategy, which has allowed us to drive hundreds of new reviews. These reviews have lead to the creation of dozens of new pieces of marketing collateral. Even the occasional negative review has allowed our Customer Success and Support teams to get involved in monitoring reviews. I really like how we've been able to use our G2 profile as a lead generation source. Once the lead form is completed, I receive a notification and the lead is added to my instance of Salesforce so that I can track it.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: My company is used across a number of different industries and is applicable across a lot of different user types. As a result, my company's product is listed in a lot of grid reports. It can be a bit challenging to drive reviews for all of the different use cases and industries. I would like to see more internal adoption of the intent data and comparison pages. I think G2 does a great job of putting a lot of data into your hands, but I'd like to see G2 make it simple to leverage that data to help their customers make smart decisions in terms of which prospects to focus on and which ones to put into a nurture track.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: The problems we are solving by utilizing G2 are manyfold. First of all, G2 produces seasonal grid reports, which we use to generate awareness and attract prospective customers. G2 provides a platform for our customers to share their thoughts and feelings about our product with their peers and with us, the vendor. I consider a customer's G2 review along with a few other data points when deciding which customers I want to invite to my advocacy program. The content we create by leveraging the review quotes has been some of our highest converting assets. I would highly recommend partnering with G2 if you truly aspire to be a customer-centric company.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Understanding and knowing when a company is exploring my companies reviews and/or my competitor's reviews. Having this in real-time or close to real-time can really increase my response rate. For example, I see they are looking at comparing vendors to one of my competitors. That tells me they are already in talks with that competitor and looking to see who else they should consider - enter me!

There are major upsides to using G2 not just for competitive comparisons but also to reflect on what your customer like and/or dislike. This can be great feedback for customer success teams and product teams! It also helps me understand what I need to do a better job of explaining specific features/use cases. 

I also love that I can get insights/alert via slack! I'm sure they have several integrations that would work for any b2b company.


SurveyID: 4668614
Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Too many email notifications - I wish they wouldn't send repetitive alerts within the same week for the same company. It's overkill, but at the same time It makes sure I don't miss anything! I know they can't share personal information but that would obviously be great! Given you don't have insights into the person who was researching on g2, you have to get a little creative and leverage a larger net for your initial outreach. 

I don't like that the last review (video) is automatically the first thing a customer sees, if this isn't a good review but there are 8 others that are, why does it have to be highlighted? I feel like our company should get to choose which video is shown on our main page on G2. 

Information isn't always accurate that is left by our customers, I can specifically see where they have made false claims. Most are not from verified customers which makes me think, could this bad review be a competitor trying to tarnish my brand?

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: Understanding what my customers like/dislike about my software. Realized compelling reviews can help me in my sales cycles in addition to my competitor's negative reviews. 

I learned how to narrow my outreach to the right persons I suspect to have triggered the g2 alert -  you can always check out location data and use that as a filter in LinkedIn sales Nav.

I also realized how much motivation the insights provide me and my team.. prospecting can be disheartening at times and having a little extra help can go a long way!

In regard to my dislike (see below) I love that we can respond to reviews left by customers.  "Information isn't always accurate that is left by our customers, I can specifically see where they have made false claims. Most are not from verified customers which makes me think, could this bad review be a competitor trying to tarnish my brand?"

Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Their algorithm is very misleading. The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks. We've found the experience with G2 to be very disappointing and borderline dishonest. I'm not hopeful that we'll hear back from them. We've discontinued all promotions of our profile on G2.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: It's super difficult to get in touch with them to actually spend money with. Then when you finally do get in touch with them, they are so slow at updating the product profiles that you may as well do it yourself. We worked with them to update our profile and they told us that if we sent updates on all the listings in a single batch, they would do on the backend. That was on May 17th. Now it's June 10th and they have done precisely nothing. By comparison, TrustRadius updated within two weeks. IT Central haven't stopped emailing us weekly to work out how they can help further. Capterra gave us access within days. G2 is asleep at the wheel, their sales team barely responsive. The sales experience is frankly appalling and substandard.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: We've been trying to work with them on profile updates and to actually spend money with them for over 6 weeks. This company has no sense of urgency, no prioritization for those that want to spend money with them. It's a terrible experience. We have achieved nothing with them to date.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2 dashboards make it very easy for me to track the performance of all our products on G2, as well as manage review campaigns. I have all the data I need to design our review strategy for the upcoming months or to share our progress with the company at the tips of my fingers. The best part is, of course, quarterly G2 award badges. Being able to win awards by market segment, region, and theme (like "Best Results" or "Easy to Use") helps us highlight our value propositions for different audiences.

Never have I appreciated a partnership more - the level of attention, strategic support and responsiveness that the G2 team consistently delivers is unmatched. Not only are they always going above and beyond to nurture our partnership, but they never fail to keep our company's goals and strategic priorities at the forefront of their recommendations.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: What I like best about G2's Marketing Solutions is the dedicated support you get from your Account Manager / Account Executive. They ensure that you get your G2 account set up for maximum impact, and also provide best-practice insights on how to drive authentic, stellar reviews from your customers. Their quarterly reports are also great 'milestones' to plan your review-growth goals by, as they give you something to 'aim for' in your efforts to grow your G2 presence.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Sometimes the internal Admin menu setup is a little confusing to navigate. I guess that this is partially because of how many features/options G2 has, but perhaps this could be laid out a little better. Also, some of the ranking metrics G2 uses to place your company in the rankings for appropriate categories don't always seem to relate to product maturity. I.e. the number of employees in a company. I understand that this can, at times, impact product quality, but at the same time - a large company doesn't an excellent product make!

SurveyID: 7058801
Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I do not like that the information about the written and rejected reviews is hidden. There have been several instances where reviews written by our clients have been rejected for no good reason. In case there are controversial issues with the review, it would be better to transparently resolve them directly with the product team.
The market Presence Scoring algorithm is a bit 'blurry'. We can't directly influence this and your position on the G2 grid.
Very long questionnaire, please make it lightweight because it is difficult to get customers to go through all the pages of the questionnaire in order for the review to be qualified for the report.
Also, make screenshot a required field, because it's optional now and clients don't add it, but it's a reason for you to reject the review.

The second thing might be that getting the credit card receipt is a bit complicated when you buy buyer incentive credits from Amazon. We have to go through our rep. to get it. That would be nice to get automatically sent to us.

But the most important is the G2 team working with you. They are professionals that help you to get the maximum from your experience. In some way, it feels like you reinforced your own team with new members who generate ideas of what else could be done to improve your marketing results and even do part of your job (like outreach and so on).

But I would recommend that all who think about using G2 on a pro level invest a bit of their time learning what's in the admin panel to ensure better understanding from the beginning.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The peer-review-led aspect of how G2 ranks solutions helps to provide a greater validity to our software and its offering.  Despite needing a large upfront payment, it tends to prove more cost-effective in the long term than some of the biddable PPC directories, where you ultimately end up driving up the PPC every month but the number of clicks and leads remain the same.

Our account and customer success managers, Austin and Michael, have both been great in helping us to optimise our profile and get the most out of our G2 package.

Also, really like the new profile sections in the software categories, with the addition of extra data and ratings info.


SurveyID: 7080431
Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: Price increase for renewal was quite a jump in 2022, which wasn't ideal.

Gathering reviews can be difficult due to the need for customers to have to log into G2 in order for them to be validated.  Obviously we understand the need to ensure reviews are genuine and of high quality, but we do get regular push-back from our customers who are willing to leave a review, but have abandoned their review or just won't complete one due to the login requirement and length of the questionnaire.  The screenshot aspect in particular has proved an annoyance for many.

It's a shame badges awarded to software providers are not displayed alongside each providers profile on the software category list.  It'd be a great addition to add extra kudos to profiles.

Answers: Nothing really comes to mind about the Marketing Solutions themselves, but gathering reviews is key to the success of the marketing material, and some customers express that writing a review can be time-consuming, so that's one thing I guess I can say I dislike. That said, having a slightly higher threshold for review writers is what ensures they're real and credible, so I probably wouldn't want to change it even if it's a bit of a hurdle for some.

We also use Buyer Intent data to help understand what types of companies and industries our platform is most relevant for, and who is interested in our service.

The other thing I'd love would be the ability to control what data/new accounts we move to HubSpot through the integration. In its current shape, the integration is a bit noisy.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: However, all the functionalities we can use with the paid version have not yet sparked a lot of enthusiasm in our company. For example, you don't see why a review has been rejected, there's not much going on concerning intent data, and for paid promotions (ads in your category) you need to pay extra PLUS you have to make sure to secure your spot before your competitor, which hasn't been a pleasant experience so far...especially because there wasn't much traffic generated either by these ads.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The intent data is often incorrect or irrelevant. There seems to be a number of issues with the platform over the past several months where the dashboard doesn't work properly and provides inconsistent data.
The dashboard often ignores our ICP/Vertical settings and provides data on irrelevant companies. This causes issues with our ABM strategy.
G2's Customer Success/Relationship Team are unhelpful and have litle to no understanding of their own platform. They often make promises to follow up on our issues but never do. 
Recently our Customer Success and Relationship Managers dumped us and passed us on to a new Manager who has not taken any time to work with us.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: G2 helps potential customers compare our software against our competitors. This is useful because we're in a fairly niche industry, and so the category is relatively small. That means everyone gets a fair shot.
The awards and badges we receive add weight to our marketing campaigns because G2 is a trusted source of genuine reviews (their review process requires moderation by their team, so you know they're all genuine) . Also, the requirement to write engaging review content rather than just a few yes/no answers helps other people make informed decisions when choosing software.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2 has a very strong and well-established name within the SaaS 'affiliate' space and therefore has become a synonymous place for potential clients to research software solutions and explore comparisons between alternates. The backend CMS is well defined and offers great tools to track and monitor prospects from both an ABM and brand point of view.

Questiontype: hate
Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: It's not one size fits all, and even though the g2 matrix has been developed in such a way that no matter where you are in the grid it is viewed as a 'positive' however this is not the case externally as all SaaS services would like to be in the leader quadrant if not the no. 1 spot. The challenge is that if your SaaS service is a niche product offering or a service that is expertise focused it can be extremely difficult to maintain and climb this 'ladder' effectively especially when past reviews are discounted negatively, despite the users and companies still actively using one's product.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2 provides an all-in-one solution which is easy to understand and implement. We evaluated other review sites before choosing G2. G2 stood out regarding team response, the information provided through the sales cycle, and the fact that it is all packaged together in one solution rather than pay-to-play. This option suits us better at this point. It's also easier to implement and get going with the review collection. I can't speak highly enough of Nathan and Jade, whom I work with on the G2 side - some of the best customer support I have experienced, and it's a joy to work with them. They share helpful tips and updates, which are really appreciated. That's what builds loyalty, and importantly they also deliver results!

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The best thing for me is the intent data, being able to see the companies viewing your profile or researching competitors is brilliant. What sets G2 apart from other intent platforms I've used is the integrations and the support from our CSM and AE. 

The way that G2 has integrations with Salesforce, LeanData & SalesLoft means it perfectly integrates with our tech stack, meaning we can create rigorous processes for the leads we get. We can also easily create social audiences to retarget those visitors, removing the manual work is a real game changer for the data we see come in. 

The support we get is also far above what I've experienced before, the team always brings ideas to our monthly calls to help us get the most from the tool.

As G2 handles the reviews entirely, customers can be sure these are independent and tamper-free -- this in turn helps vendors build trust, by showing prospects what customers truly think of the brand and its offerings. The platform also serves as a window into a company's solutions, by enabling vendors to set up and update product pages with ease.

In order to improve ourselves, we prefer to reach out to the reviewer directly and have a clear plan with him. In case we know the reviewer, it is straightforward for us to contact and apply a quick mitigation plan.
You can't generate the personal link and follow the incoming reviews per CSM.

Answers: Review verification is not always accurate. Real reviews are being left out or rejected. There is no appeals process or way to see who the feedback is from so we are missing reviews. There should be a way for a company to verify that the reviewer is actually real.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: G2 itself is extremely janky. We had to write up & justify the category that we belong in because G2 didn't understand our industry. We needed to explain why we should or shouldn't be tucked up underneath other categories. We needed to explain, in long-form, why certain companies they identified as our competitors should not even *be* in the category they threw them into.

Talking with Monty, he literally could not even recognize our product category and instead provided to me pages of unrelated market segments. When I gave him the exact page in G2 that I was referring to it said "I don't have access to live G2 database but I rely on set of structured database information which I currently lack for [my company's category]."

While we had initial traction in getting reviews once we signed the contract, that dried up quickly (after 1-2 months) and then we haven't gotten *any* reviews in the past half-year.

I wish I got sentiment analytics on the page even if someone *didn't* leave a review. I wish there was a way to know how many users were "watching us" or whether they had a positive brand sentiment. I can see pageviews, but I wish I could tell if folks were "subscribed" to our brand. So we could push updated information to those who had more than passing interest.

Questions: What problems is G2 Marketing Solutions solving and how is that benefiting you?
Answers: We want a public "score" for our product and have that appear in a place where our competitors also appear. We want to at least be given our fair share of voice. So far G2 has allowed us to be findable in a head-to-head comparison site.

It is simple enough for a team of one to learn quickly, but robust enough for an entire marketing org to find value out of it. More than anything, the direct support I've received from G2 has been huge in my continuing to advocate and find value in the platform. Our Account Manager and Customer Success Manager have become valued professional peers — it really feels like I've built a rapport with them. They are patient and not pushy and bring a consultative approach to our partnership.

Questions: What do you like best about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: I've been working with G2 with my company's upgraded profile accounts for years now and each year is better than the last. Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.

The vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. 

Implementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.

Integrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. 

Review generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.

Buyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.

G2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time. Compared to other review vendors, the portal is always running well and ive experienced little to no system errors.

But if you reach out to your CSM, they'll get that for you very quickly.

Answers: G2 marketing has complately changed how we approach out go-to-market strategy. We utilize our earned badges and our quarterly reports in our marketing efforts so much. We are much more motivated to run review campaigns and/or keep our profile updated to get the best results whether it be in organic traffic, conversion, lead flow, etc. G2 works very hard to help you help your company be the best customer-facing profile it can be for your key buyers. Additionally, they make all the marketing assets easily accessible and the CSMs are really good at suggesting where and how to present badges, reports, grid images, and more.

Answers: G2 Is a highly reputable website and allows our customers to review us honestly. The portal is really easy to use and I have particuarly found the new AI reply feature really helpful, especially when we're so busy. Running campaigns is really simple, we supply a list and G2 looks after everything. I think the best thing about G2 though is the support from our Account Manager; whether it's assisting with campaigns, helping us produce video reviews or the constant feedback about where we are and how we can improve.

Questions: What do you dislike about G2 Marketing Solutions?
Answers: The biggest downside is not being able to incentivize reviews for non-subscribed products. I feel like this unfairly skews ratings and reviews across products. I wish that the platform offered an annual or bi-annual option for all vendors to load funds for an ad-hoc review collection campaign without vendors having to pay for an entire subscription. Also, we gather many reviews through review sourcing campaigns, but the reviews often times aren't the highest quality, because the review form is very simple. I wish their was a middle ground of the intricateness of the G2 & TR review forms. There is also a frequent tech issues that I run into when I'm inside the vendor portal. When I'm switching from a subscribed product to a non-subscribed product and back to a subscribed product, the subscribed product info begins to display like a non-subscribed product. I always have to refresh the page and navigate directly back to the subscribed product for the normal view to resume.
