I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention our fantastic account team. Jeremy Levin has been an incredible resource for us as we've grown into new categories and analyzed competitors. In addition to simply answering questions, he comes to the table with suggestions as new products, features, or grids roll out to help us get the most bang for our buck. I would love to understand more, from a competitive perspective, how other vendors are able to rank on specific grids. There are cases where some vendors are on a specific grid that I don't believe belong, and it's difficult to understand how they got there and create a ""dismiss"" talk track for our sellers.",['- Customer Satisfaction\n- Comparative Analysis']

The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks.

G2 stood out regarding team response, the information provided through the sales cycle, and the fact that it is all packaged together in one solution rather than pay-to-play. This option suits us better at this point. It's also easier to implement and get going with the review collection. I can't speak highly enough of Nathan and Jade, whom I work with on the G2 side - some of the best customer support I have experienced, and it's a joy to work with them. They share helpful tips and updates, which are really appreciated. That's what builds loyalty, and importantly they also deliver results!

An industry leader in tech customer reviews!,5,"The vendor portal is extremely user-friendly and there are always helpful updates being made to improve user experience. I love the ability for reviewers to opt-in as references, this adds a lot of business value to our investment. All our CSMs have also been top-notch quality, so incredibly attentive, friendly, and proactive. It's also great that we can add in our own customer review questions! The webhooks is also an incredible feature that comes with our paid product profiles. The leads generated from these webhooks really helps to outrightly prove the value of our investment to leadership.","The biggest downside is not being able to incentivize reviews for non-subscribed products. I feel like this unfairly skews ratings and reviews across products. I wish that the platform offered an annual or bi-annual option for all vendors to load funds for an ad-hoc review collection campaign without vendors having to pay for an entire subscription. Also, we gather many reviews through review sourcing campaigns, but the reviews often times aren't the highest quality, because the review form is very simple. I wish their was a middle ground of the intricateness of the G2 & TR review forms. There is also a frequent tech issues that I run into when I'm inside the vendor portal. When I'm switching from a subscribed product to a non-subscribed product and back to a subscribed product, the subscribed product info begins to display like a non-subscribed product. I always have to refresh the page and navigate directly back to the subscribed product for the normal view to resume.","An industry leader in tech customer reviews!
